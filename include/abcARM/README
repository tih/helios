README to find out about the Helios C and hobjasm include files
===============================================================

The sub-directory "asm" contains the system "hobjasm" include (GET) files.
At the moment these will need to be kept in step with the Helios system
source AMPP header files. This is because the actual ABC Helios/ARM system
is still under development (Split Module Table support, etc.). Eventually
a stable set of headers (MACROs and MANIFESTs) will be produced. Until that
point it is worth-noting that MACROs will appear, change and disappear.

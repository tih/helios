Purpose:     Force a sync operation immediately.
Format:      sync <PathToVolume>
Description: The utility sync forces an "extra" sync operation which guarantees
             that all data blocks in the buffer cache with the "delayed-write" 
             flag set are written immediately to disc. sync is especially 
             useful to guarantee consistency if the file server or the whole 
             system shall be shut down.

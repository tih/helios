Purpose:     Generates a "SCSI-information file".
Format:      gsi <Input> <Output>
Descripiton: gsi is a simple compiler which generates a binary object from the
             given SCSI-information <Input> file. The file name which is 
             searched by the new MSC device driver is '/helios/etc/scsiinfo',
             so gsi's <Output> has to be that name.

This directory contains:

  -Several SCSI device descriptions:

    exabytef.src  (fixed block length (1 KByte), compatible to PFS 2.x versions)
    exabytev.src  (variable block length; try this if you have problems in 
                   reading tapes not written with the PFS)
    maxtorl.src
    maxtorp.src
    rodime.src
    sony.src
    tandberg.src  
    wren.src

    You can create your <MySCSI>.src by typing

    % cat  <Device1>.src  <Device2>.src   >   <MySCSI>.src

    (scsiinfo.src was created by 'cat'ing wren.src ... exabytev.src).
    But be careful: the type entries in the devinfo file depend on the order
    of device descriptions in scsiinfo. The gsi command displays every device
    actually compiled with its corresponding order number.  Your type values 
    in devinfo have to refer to that numbers.
    

  -A standard device description pattern which helps you to install new (so far
   unknown) SCSI devices:
   
    pattern.src 

  -A mini devinfo pattern for testing new SCSI devices:

    newdev.src

  -A mini devinfo pattern for updating HFS v1.x to PFS v2.1:

    hfs2pfs.src

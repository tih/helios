\begin{man}
  \PP Terminate a volume.
  \FO {\tt termvol [-v] <PathToVolume>}
  \DE The volume specified by {\tt <PathToVolume>} is terminated.
             Therefore the volume is unloaded and then the volume specific
             central server is terminated. A volume which has been terminated 
             cannot be loaded again before starting the file server again. If 
             all volumes have been terminated the whole file server will 
             terminate automatically.
             \begin{note}
               With respect to safety of data there's no command to terminate
               all volumes (and thereby the complete file server) at once.
             \end{note}

             Option:

             \begin{itemize}
             \item {\tt -v}\newline
               The termvol command waits for the completion of the volume
               termination.

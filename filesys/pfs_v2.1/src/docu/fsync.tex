  \PP Toggle between partly and fully synchronous mode.
  \FO {\tt fsync <PathToVolume> [-as]}
  \DE {\tt fsync} allows the selection between two operation modes: at volume
             load time the default mode is the partly synchronous mode ({\tt -a})
             which means that all data-blocks are written with a certain delay
             (of max. 20 seconds) to disc, when the ``sync process''---which is
             part of the server---becomes active and detects some of them. To
             guarantee that all blocks are written directly to disc
             (``write-through-cache''), the user has the alternative to switch to
             fully synchronous mode ({\tt -s}) , which eliminates all delayed-write
             operations.

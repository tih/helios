\begin{man}
  \PP Create a file system.
  \FO {\tt makefs <PathToVolume>}
  \DE This command works with structured volumes only.
             A new file system is tried to be created on the volume depending
             on the volume\slash partition description in \HEDI\ (that was
             created via the {\tt gdi} command). The volume has to be loaded with
             the {\tt -m} option and physically formatted, otherwise {\tt makefs} returns
             an error. On success {\tt makefs} reports about the number of cylinder
             groups and blocks per cylinder group of the file system it has
             installed.

             \begin{caution}
               When accidently running on a data containing file system, all
               files will be destroyed.
             \end{caution}

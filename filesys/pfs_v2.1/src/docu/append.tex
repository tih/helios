\section{Quick reference to the \SI\ keywords}\index{scsiinfo@\SI}
The following section describes each keyword, the type of value which it
expects and the default value assumed if the keyword is omitted. The default
value {\tt <None>} marks keywords which must be given a value.

\section{\SI\ syntax definition}\label{app:si_syntax}
\index{scsiinfo@\SI}
The following syntax definition specifies all items and their order of
appearance, using these symbols:

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}

                              optional.      \\
\{ \}\index{$\lbrace \rbrace$}
                            & Braces surround optional items that can be
                              repeated.      \\

                              expectations.  \\
\ldots \index{$\ldots$}     & Three dots denote continuation of a series; for
                              example, 12\ldots 89 is the same as the series
                              123456789.     \\

\section{Quick reference to the \DI\ keywords}\index{devinfo@\DI}

There are some keywords that must be given a fixed value:

{\small
  \begin{tabular}{llrp{7.5cm}}
    keyword    & member of  &   must be & meaning \\
    \hline
    addressing & discdevice &      1024 & Discdevice's addressing size \\

}

The other keyword's values a chosen by the user. A default of {\tt<None>} forces the
user to give a value to the keyword.

\chapter{Errors}
There are several error messages that may occur when starting\slash running
the file server or any of the utilitiy commands. We differ between fatal error
conditions that lead to stopping a program (e g not enough memory for the
file server and its buffer cache) and normal errors\slash warnings that result 
in non performing of command (e g a full disc) but keep the file server running.
Most of the messages explain theirselves, here are the most important ones:

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  Text:                & {\tt Failed to load devinfo.}                      \\
  Description:         & The file server did not find the device information
                         file that usually has to be placed in \HE\ or given as
                         parameter.                                         \\
  Corrective measures: & Create the required file by editing the \HEDIS\ file 
                         and compiling that via the {\tt gdi} command.      \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  Text:                & {\tt Failed to find filesystem info.}               \\
  Description:         & The value of the last parameter of {\tt fs} and the
                         value of the {\it fileserver} keyword in your \DI\
                         are not equal.                                      \\
  Corrective measures: & Reenter your {\tt fs} call (if there was an error in
                         typing) or correct the value in your \DI\ (don't
                         forget to use the {\tt gdi} command afterwards).\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  Text                 & {\tt Failed to find discdevice info.}                \\
  Description:         & In your \DI\ there's no discdevice block
                         corresponding to the value you gave to {\it device}
                         in the {\it fileserver} block.                                               \\
  Corrective measures: & Complete your \DI\ and recompile it (use {\tt gdi}). \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  Text                 & {\tt Failed to open device.}                       \\

  Corrective measures: & \begin{itemize}

                           \item Usually, the device driver's name as written
                                 in \DI's discdevice block (following the name
                                 keyword) does not correspond to an existing
                                 file.

                                 \begin{note}
                                   The name should be {\tt msc21.dev} and is
                                   expanded to
                                   {\tt /helios\slash lib\slash msc21.dev}.
                                   Assert that this file contains your device
                                   driver.

                           \item Maybe you didn't start the file server on a
                                 MSC node. The correct call is

                                 \fbox{\tt \% remote -d MSC fs msc21}

                           \item You have an old MSC board in use and didn't 
                                 perform an update of your hardware. See section
                                 \ref{sec:hwupdate} for further information.

                           \item Else there could be problems with your SCSI
                                 devices or the SCSI bus. Check your hardware
                                 and try it again.

  Corrective measures: & \begin{itemize}

                           \item Have a look at your \DI\ file. Maybe your 
                                 buffer cache appotionment via

                                 MSC board offers. Correct the values.
                           \item You've already started a file server and some 
                                 difficulties occured, so that you wanted to 
                                 restart the file server, but it's still in 
                                 memory. Note that you have to terminate 
                                 {\bf all} volumes, even though one of them was
                                 not loaded.

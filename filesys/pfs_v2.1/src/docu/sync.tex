  \PP Force a sync operation immediately.
  \FO {\tt sync <PathToVolume>}
  \DE The utility {\tt sync} forces an ``extra'' sync operation which guarantees
             that all data blocks in the buffer cache with the ``delayed-write''
             flag set are written immediately to disc. {\tt sync} is especially
             useful to guarantee consistency if the file server or the whole
             system shall be shut down.

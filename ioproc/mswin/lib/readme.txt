DOS 6.0 Problem:

The ethernet option of the I/O server may not work with Microsoft DOS
version 6.0.  Using memmaker to optimize the memory usage may correct
this problem.

DLINK DE220 Problem:

The DLINK DE220 packet driver seems to have some problems and can cause 
windows to crash on receipt of packets.  The NE2000 packet driver is 
supposed to work with this ethernet card, but we have been unable to get
this to work as yet.

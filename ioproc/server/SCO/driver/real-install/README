Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board
===============================

  The Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board can be configured with

i)	An interrupt vector ranging from 2 to 7.
ii)	A base address ranging from 0x0 to 0xFC0. 

Note that the BBK-PC cannot use DMA.

  The BBK-PC driver can be configured to use all the interrupt vectors
and base addresses starting from 0x0 and going up to 0xFC0 in steps of
0x20 (ie 0x0, 0x20, 0x40, ..., 0xFA, 0xFC).  How the device is
configured is encoded in the minor device as follows -

bits	0, 1, 2		- IRQ Number
bits	3 - 10		- Base Address divided by 0x20

For example, to if the device is configured such that it uses IRQ 5
and base address 0x140, the minor device number should be 0x55.
This is equivalent to 00001010101, with the lowest 3 bits being 5 and
the rest being 0xA, which when multiplied by 0x20 equals 0x140 as
required.

  Using this scheme allows a total of 126 separate device units (from
0 to 125).  The unit number is given by the encoded base address.  (In
the example above, the encoded base address was 0xA and hence the unit
number for the device is 10).

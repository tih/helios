	sorry. The .at domain still confuse mailers since it used to be an

Well,

here they come. I'm not sure what you're trying to connect. We're using
the packet driver with NCSA Telnet, and KA9Q (a pre-NOS release).
The PD is a real hack; I wonder if it will work for you. Anyway..

We have PC's on a Sytek LAN, and a PC running KA9Q as a bridge into ethernet.
The clients use the packet driver and NCSA Telnet or ka9q wover the pd.
The bridge has its own pd (which I include 'for reference'), and
the standard builtin 3c501 ethernet driver.

The point is that the pd's have to be set up such that all traffic goes
to the bridge; the upper layer doesnt pass a gateway IP adress, and arp
doesnt work. The PD is class 6 ('SLIP'), i.e. no lan headers, no arp,
MTU is 512 bytes (a NetBIOS limit,grrr).

Setup:
------

Assume your ka9q bridge has IP 192.13.1.128. Your Netbios client has
IP address 192.13.1.131.

On the client, insert

'nb 0x7f 192.13.1.131 192.13.1.128'
into autoexecbat. This will load the pd, and set the 'gateway' ip address.

The KA9Q autoexec.net reads:
---------

# Attach interfaces
# Syntax: attach <hw type> <I/O address> <vector> <mode> <label>
#                <bufsize> <mtu> [<speed>]
#
#
hostname bull
ip ttl 16
ip address [192.13.1.128]
attach netbios arpa nb0 5 512
attach 3c500 0x300 5 arpa ec0 10 1500
#
route add default ec0
route add [192.13.1.128/28] nb0
....
------------

Alternatively, one could use a pd on ka9q as well.

Here's the relevant fragment of ncsa telnet config.tel:

---------------------------
myip=192.13.1.131		# ip types are
hardware=packet
address=6                       # base memory address or packet driver class
                                # if using packet driver (0 == default ==
 ethernet)
                                # or class=6 for slip
ioaddr=0                        # I/O address  or packet int vector if using
 packet driver
                                # If = 0 and packet driver, telbin looks for
 first
                                # packet driver found between 60H and 7FH
.....
maxseg=440                      # largest segment we can receive
rwin=440                        # most bytes we can receive without ACK
------------------------------


At last:
Here it is. Use the Turbo Assembler and linker and create a com file (order of
binaries is important):

tasm nbhead;
tasm nb;
tasm tail;
tlink nbhead.obj+nb.obj+tail.obj;
exe2bin nbhead.exe nb.com

-enjoy,
michael

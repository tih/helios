The following freely copyable software supports the packet driver
spec.

The Packet Driver Specification, version 1.09

	vax.ftp.com:pub/packet-d.ascii
	vax.ftp.com:pub/packet-d.mss

Clarkson's (Russ Nelson) collection of packet drivers.

	sun.soe.clarkson.edu:pub/packet-drivers/drivers.zip
	sun.soe.clarkson.edu:pub/packet-drivers/driverss.zip

NCSA's Telnet.

	zaphod.ncsa.uiuc.edu (128.174.20.50).

Clarkson's (Brad Clements) version of NCSA Telnet.

	The current version of CUTCP (Clarkson's version of NCSA Telnet)
	is available for FTP from
	omnigate.clarkson.edu:pub/cutcp/2.2-C/tc.cutcp.zoo

Phil Karn's TCP/IP package (freely copyable only for radio amateurs and
	educational institutions.  Others should contact him.)

	The latest version of NOS is always available for FTP from
	thumper.bellcore.com:pub/ka9q/nos/src.zip

Dan Laniani's Harvard version of CMU's version of MIT's version of PC-IP.

	The source for PC-IP is available from
	husc6.harvard.edu:/pub/pcip/pcip.tar.Z

	Executables compiled for the packet drivers are available from
	the same sources as the packet drivers.  Look for pcippkt.arc.

BYU's packet driver IPX.COM.

	A copy is kept on sun.soe.clarkson.edu:/pub/novell/novell.exe

Vance Morrison's PCROUTE.

	There is a beta version of PCroute with packet driver support
	available on accvuax.nwu.edu (129.105.49.1) in pub/pcroute/exp.
	In this directory you will find two files 'packpack.exe' and
	'packslip.exe'.   These files are compiled versions of pcroute
	the first configured to be used with two packet drivers, and
	the second configured for one packet driver and one slip line.

	In addition the pub/pcroute/exp directory is the standard PCroute
	documentation modfied to include packet driver details, as well
	as a file 'packet.txt' which is a sample installtion of the 
	packpack.exe code.

	So if you have wanted to use PCroute, but didn't have WD8003E
	cards here is your chance to try it out.  If you do try out the
	code, please send me a note saying so (so I can know if anyone
	really cares), and also send any comments/bugs of interest.
	The code will not be nearly as speedy as the native driver, but
	I am not sure how much (I estimate about 1/3 the speed).  Any 
	comments/measurments on the speed would also be appreciated.

	At present the source for the additional code is not available 
	because it is easer for me to wait until I have had some feedback
	and then simply integrate it into the standard release.

Jan Engvald's PDCLKSET, a program to set the time on a PC.

	For MSDOS machines I suggest you try PDCLKSET, available by
	anonymous FTP from
	Pollux.lu.se:/pub/network/pdclkset/pdclk088.zip . It requires
	a packet driver, is very small (7 kbyte) and fast (can be
	included in  AUTOEXEC.BAT without noticeble delay). It knows
	a lot about daylight saving algorithms all over the world,
	but in the case of UK the implemented algorithm may not be
	true every coming year, lacking an officially defined DLS
	rule.

Joe Doupnik's version of MIT's NETWATCH.

	netlab.usu.edu, 129.123.1.11, in directory
	[anonymous.netwatch]. It's a VMS machine so do cd [.netwatch]
	with the brackets and the dot.

Stan's Own Server (NFS server).

	Available from same place as Clarkson collection of packet drivers.
	Look for pcip_sos.arc (source changes to pcip), and sos_pkt.exe
	(pcip_sos compiled for packet drivers).

PC-NFS drivers.

	Available from same place as Clarkson collection of packet drivers.
	Look for compat.tar.Z, or compat.zip (identical contents, different
	archiver).  Note that you need to purchase PC-NFS from Sun in order
	to use this package.

FTP Software's packet-driver-over-NDIS simulator.

	FTP Software has created a program that uses an NDIS driver
	to emulate a packet driver.  It is freely copyable, and
	located on VAX.FTP.COM, in the directory pub/packet.driver/NDIS.

University of Minnesota's POPmail POP2 client.

	POPmail is a POP2 client that will let you read your mail stored
	on a machine running a POP2 server.  Fetch
	boombox.micro.umn.edu:/pub/POPmail/msdos/version.2.0/00README
	to decide which files to get.

Bob Crosson's SNMP monitor.

	In the anonymous FTP directory on host enh.nist.gov (129.6.16.1) are
	two files in compressed tar format.  This is a VAX running VMS so
	the file names may look a little strange.  The file snmplib.tar_z
	contains the libraries, executables, and minimal documentation.  The
	file snmpsrc.tar_z contains all sources (both the main program and
	the libraries) and all available documentation.

Mississippi State University's LPD, FTP, and BOOTP servers

	A beta test version of a freeware LPD for MSDOS can be found
	in the ftp-archive at tacky.cs.olemiss.edu in directory
	pub/lpd. It uses some version of Clarkson or NCSA libraries
	and workes quite well in some first tests here. Besides the
	LPD part there is also a FTP and a BOOTP server included,
	which we also find very useful.

	Sun Microsystem's PC-NFS (unofficially).
	The Wollongong Group's WIN/TCP (and friends).
	Gateway Communications Inc's packet driver.
	D-Link Systems Inc.'s D-Link Ethernet card packet driver.
	Beame and Whiteside's BWNFS and BWKTEL (NFS and TELNET packages)
	MD-DOS/IP (available from Wiscware, wiscware@wiscmacc.bitnet)
	Cabletron supplies a packet driver with their Ethernet cards.
	Intel supplies a packet driver with their Ethernet cards.

The following companies have donated Ethernet cards to Clarkson University.

	AT&T's Bell Labs donated two Starlan 10BaseT cards, an AUI, and
		a coax adapter.

		Ethertwist cards, two 16-bit ISA Ethertwist cards,
		two MCA Ethertwist cards and two ISA Thinwire cards.

		and a 16-bit card.

Here are some things that might be problems:

  o The DE-600 driver will only work the first time after powering up the
    machine.  After that, it doesn't recognize the existance of the adapter.

  o There is more than one product called the DEPCA.  The enclosed packet
    driver only works on the newer boards.  See DEPCA.NOT for details.

  o Several people reported that the 7.x 3c505 driver didn't work.
    Then again, one person reported that it *did* work.

  o The 8.x driver ignores that class of your driver when your
    application asks for all packets regardless of type.  This is
    very unlikely to cause problems, but should be documented anyway.

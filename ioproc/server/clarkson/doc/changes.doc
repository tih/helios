Summary of changes in the 9.x release:

	The -n switch works again.  It was broken in the 8.x release.
	Bugs fixed: ibmtoken, others.

Versions:

If you already have an older packet driver, you may wish to upgrade.
You should base this decision on the contents of the "Changes..."
section below.  The major version (currently 9) goes up with every
release.  The minor version (.x, different for every driver) goes up
with every significant change in the device dependent part.  Some
drivers, at&t, 3c507, 3c523, ncret105, ubnicps2, ni5210, and ni9210,
all depend on 82586.asm, so they have a subminor version number which
is the version of 82586.asm.  Some drivers, hppclan, ne1000, ne2000,
3c503, and wd8003e, all depend on 8390.asm, so they have a subminor
version number which is the version of 8390.asm. If the minor version
hasn't changed, then chances are very good that no significant bugs
have been introduced.  Sometimes the file is changed without changing
the version number.  This is done only when an identical change is
made to all drivers to fix a bug that appears in every driver.

Back issues:

Back issues of the packet drivers are available on
sun.soe.clarkson.edu.  See HOWTOGET.IT for information on accessing
sun.soe.

Changes from version 8.x to 9.x of the drivers:

Some 8.x drivers complained about int_no needing to be greater than 2.
Using the -n switch caused the driver to go deaf.
The set_address() routine was broken.
The set_rcv_mode() routine no longer returns an error if the requested
	mode is the same as the current mode.
Some NE1000 manufacturers use invalid manufacturer codes in their
	Ethernet addresses.  They are invalid because the multicast bit is
	set.  The driver will reset the bit and whine at you about it.
The wd8003e usage message didn't include the -o switch.  The error
	message for non-responding memory mentioned IO addresses wrongly.
Brian Fisher send in code for the tiara driver to read the POS registers.
Pktaddr, pktmode, and pktstat used to use a completely bogus packet type
	of length 8.  That confused Joe Doupnik's dis_pkt (packet driver over
	NDIS driver) converter.  I changed it to use a bogus type of
	length 2.
Mark Power <mpower@beowulf.his.uab.edu> found a few bugs in the ibmtoken
	driver.


Summary of changes in the 8.x release:

	New drivers: HP Ethertwist, 3Com EtherLink Plus, UB NIC/PS2,
		ARLAN 450, NCR ET-105, D-Link DE-600, Mitel Express,
		NE/2, DEPCA, BICC Isolink (4110-2/3) (buggy).
	Bugs fixed: pktchk, 3c523, ibmtoken, tiara, ne2000, ubnicpc.
	All class 1 drivers can also act as class 11 drivers.

Changes from version 7.x to 8.x of the drivers:

Russell Nelson wrote an HP Ethertwist driver.  This covers the HP27245
	HP27250 HP27247 but not the HP27246 (MCA).  We could not get
	the latter driver working by release time.
Russell Nelson wrote a 3Com EtherLink Plus (3c507), UB NIC/PS2 driver,
	ARLAN 450 driver, and NCR ET-105 driver.
Glenn Talbott <gt@hprnd.rose.hp.com> suggested that the hardware be
	terminated after the interrupt was masked off, to avoid
	spurious interrupts during the termination process.
D-Link donated a DE-600 driver.
Dave Price wrote a Mitel Express (ISDN) packet driver.
Eric Henderson wrote a NE/2 packet driver.
Sylvan Butler fixed two bugs in ubnicpc.
The handle check on get_address isn't necessary, and so was removed.  The 1.09
	spec says that it's required, but that will be removed in the 1.10
	spec, as I'm told.
Doug Smith wrote a DEPCA packet driver, and Russell Nelson finished it
	off.
Russell Nelson and Tobias Reber fixed the 3c523 driver (yay!).
Renamed ubnic to ubnicpc to make it clearer which adapter it's for.
Reinhard Strebler added code to wd8003e to read the POS registers prior
	to parsing the arguments.
John A. Murphy fixed a problem in the 8390 driver whereby it could
	lose the interrupt on an incoming packet.
Gregory T Small found a bug in the packet interrupt verification (tail.asm).
Bill Rust <wjr@ftp.com> rewrote the 8259a interrupt acknowledgement
	code to use specific EOIs, which gets around the C&T bug (see
	8259.not).
There is a new helper file called printnum.asm, that prints a label,
	then a dword number in hex, then in decimal.
There is a new helper file called verifypi.asm, that verifies that a
	packet driver exists at the given interrupt.
A few messages were reworded for more clarity.
The machine type (ISA versus MCA) is now determined before the call to
	parse_args.  This is so that MCA drivers can read the POS
	registers to supply defaults.
The set_rcv_mode function will only change the receive mode if only one
	handle is open.  This prevents Novell and KA9Q users from running a
	netwatcher, which confuses both of them.
All drivers for boards using the 82586 (see Versions above) have had
	code added to compensate for some bugs in the 82586.
Reinhard Strebler found a serious bug in the 82586 where it didn't
	wait for the results of a command properly.  This fixes the bogus
	TDR reports.
All drivers for boards using the 8390 (see Versions above) have had
	the 8390-specific code consolidated into a single file.
Eric Henderson and Colin Cook's class 11 changes have been
	incorporated.  They let a single driver appear as
	multiple-class drivers.
Russell Nelson modified their code so that packet watchers still get all
	packets.
Don Provan and Jan Engvald fixed a bug in the -n switch handling.
	When -n is used, DIX Ethernet (aka Ethernet II aka Blue Book
	Ethernet) frames shouldn't be passed on as-is.  Don's fix dropped
	them, Jan's converted them to 8138 packets.  Jan's was a
	better idea.
The 3c503 driver has some code added to use the board in I/O-mapped
	mode.  Unfortunately, there wasn't time to get it working.
	It'll have to wait for the next release.
The helper file movemem.asm will use 386 memory move instructions.
The helper file getnum.asm didn't always reject invalid digits.
Brian Fisher fixed ibmtoken to flush the RIF cache using a LRU algorithm.
Russell Nelson cleaned up the multicast handling in the ni6510 driver.
Russell Nelson worked on pktsend: didn't properly check for trashed
	memory on machines with less than 640K.  Also prints the
	address of the trashed memory. It also now prints 'R' when a
	packet is received, and 'T' when a packet is transmitted.
Denis DeLaroca changed the way the 16550A is detected in slip8250.asm.
The tiara packet driver didn't work properly with the -n switch.
The ne2000 packet driver didn't work properly with the -n switch.
Russell Nelson cleaned up trace internally, no difference to the user.
John Baird wrote some ipxpkt documentation.


Changes from version 6.0 to 7.0 of the drivers:

Summary:
	New drivers: UB PC/NIC, LocalTalk, Tiara, NTI.
	Bugs fixed: 3c505, 3c503, wd8003e, nb, ne1000.
	Bug found but not fixed: 3c523.

*** The 3c523 driver is semi-broken.***  If you run the 5.x release of
the 3c523 driver (3c523_5), terminate it, then run the 7.x release (3c523),
it will work.  This need only be done once after powering-up the computer.
This will be fixed in the next release.

Drew Perkins made a bunch of changes:

pktsend now takes a length argument, (-l) so that you may send packets of a
	given length with unknown contents.
pktsend now skips blanks between the -f switch and the filename.
pktsend now takes a packet count argument (-n) which is the count of packets
	to send between keypresses.
pktsend now takes a switch to be quiet (-q).
pktsend now takes a switch (-a) to send using as_send_pkt, for testing of
	asychronous packet sending.
getnum now parses very large numbers correctly.
wd8003d now has 16 bit support for the WD8013EBT card.  Also "high
	performance" changes to WD8003E.ASM and HEAD.ASM.
fixed hangs or other errors caused by incorrect function in some 8259
	clone ICs.
enabled slave interrupts on the master 8259.  Apparently some early IBM
	BIOSes didn't do this.

John Mann submitted some code to delay the etopen and convert between
	Novell's pseudo IEEE 802.3 packets and Ethernet packets.
Jan Engvald made Mann's changes optional by adding two switches.
	The -d switch delays the initialization, and the -n switch
	converts Novell packets.  The n option converts the type 8137
	packets from the BYU packet driver IPX into Novell ISO-like
	packets. The d option delays initialization until it gets the
	first call.  Together these options make it very easy to run
	packet drivers in a PROM booted LAN PC.
Jan Engvald improved the 3c501 and ni5010 drivers, which were only
	implemented to look at the two bytes in the type field, and
	for n-option to work one has to look at at least 4 bytes.
Jan Engvald implemented Stop Function (8) that clears in use flags of
	all handles.  See README.BOT for more details.
Jan Engvald found and fixed a few coding errors in occupied.asm,
	tail.asm and wd8003e.asm.
John Mann improved the ne1000 driver.  It didn't handle large Ethernet packets
	(between 1454 and 1472 bytes of data (total packet size 1496 and
	1514 bytes).  He also changed a few hard-coded numbers into symbols.
Katie Stevens wrote a LocalTalk driver.
Katie Stevens added code to head.asm to prevent snarfing a hardware interrupt
	if the packet driver doesn't use one.
Anto Prijosoesilo, who fixed a bug related to DMA in the ni6510 driver.
Paul Kranenburg added routing support to use Novell bridges (netwide
	broadcasting and hacks to find out about IPX net addresses).
Paul Kranenburg added support for IPX node address with less than 6
	significant bytes.  (through the `-n <bytes>' command line
	option).
Paul Kranenburg added auxiliary program (ipxstat.c) to display route
	table information and a couple of other statistics (define
	STAT when compiling the driver to use this option)
John Breeden found a bug in the AT&T driver where it didn't report
	the type of an unknown card correctly.  He also added a new
	card to the list of AT&T cards (StarLAN-10 R3).
Russell Nelson fixed a problem in dump.exe where it reported the names
	of function numbers >=20 incorrectly.
Steve Wallace added a hack to let the packet drivers run under Windows.
	This is not to be construed with the proper solution, which is
	to write a TCP/IP package for Windows.  This hack is enabled only
	when you use the '-w' switch.
Russell Nelson added promiscuous mode to the ni5010 driver.
Martin Knoblauch found that the ni5010 driver was resetting the receive
	mode after each packet was received.
Russell Nelson added code to 82586.asm to allow runts to be upcalled in
	mode 6 (promiscuous mode).
Eric Henderson added Carl Beame's fix to his ne1000 driver, and he also
	copied the receive mode support from the wd8003e driver.
Reinhard Strebler added a success message to termin.asm, and an error return
	to the f_terminate call.


Changes from version 5.0 to 6.0 of the drivers:

Summary:
	New drivers: ni6510, at&t, arcnet, ipxpkt, nb, ne2000.
	New utilities: pktmulti, pktsend, pktstat.
	Bugs fixed: 3c505, 3c503, wd8003e.

Carl Beame found a bug in his National 8390 drivers which was also present
	in the drivers based on the 3c503.  To wit, when the buffers
	overflowed, there was a chance that there were no buffers present.
	Trying to read one of these buffers would cause a crash.  This
	affects the 3c503, wd8003e, and ne2000 drivers.
James A. Harvey fixed a problem in the first beta test release that caused
	some machines to incorrectly determine the number of interrupts,
	and fixed the lockup problem in the 3c503.
Russell Nelson changed the skeleton to enable compliance with version 1.09
	of the packet driver spec.
Russell Nelson wrote the following drivers: ni6510, at&t, and arcnet.
Russell Nelson wrote the following utilities pktmulti, pktsend, pktstat.
The following drivers now implement promiscuous mode: 3c501, 3c523, ni9210,
	ni5210, at&t, ni6510, wd8003e.
Jan Engvald enhanced HEAD.ASM to properly sense the second 8259a.
Denis DeLaroca fixed the 16550a support in slip8250.asm.
Glen Marianko's ROMREL program is now included for Novell users.
All of the programs may be assembled with Borland or Microsoft (5.1) products.
Some of the programs may be assembled with Microsoft v4.0 products.
The set_address function refused to change the address if there was one or
	more handles open.  One handle is allowable.
The 3c501 driver now sends large broadcast packets (i.e. BOOTP) correctly.
The routine get_multicast_list has been obsoleted by doing the same function
	totally within HEAD.ASM
The terminate routine now gets called on the f_terminate calls.
f_terminate now checks for any outstanding handles before terminating.
The parameters are now printed separately from being parsed.  This is to let
	programs determine the parameters dynamically.
The 3c503 driver was enabling interrupts when it shouldn't have.
Some drivers would return a parameter error if some of the parameters
	weren't specified.
The bus type in 82586-based drivers is now a variable rather than an equate.
The 82586-based drivers now have multicast partially implemented.
The 3c523 driver reads the POS registers before parsing the parameters.
The 82586-based drivers disable interrupts prior to being initialized.  Some
	of these drivers would generate spurious interrupt, which caused
	crashes when interrupt 2 was used.  The BIOS enables interrupt 2
	automatically.
The 82586-based drivers now sense the amount of memory automatically, even
	though they still only use 8K.  This means no problems with 386
	memory mappers.
The maximum number of handles was increased from 8 to 10 (MAX_HANDLE).
The .286 directive was removed from DEFS.ASM so that no 286 code accidentally
	slips in.
The function dispatch routine in HEAD.ASM was changed for version 1.09 of the
	PDS.
As promised in the version 4.x notes, the unique handle creation code went
	away.
If a driver sets int_no to zero, the timer interrupt won't get masked off. :-)
Dave Horne changed the 3c503 driver into a ne2000 driver.
Dave Horne changed the way upcalls are called so that the upcall handler can
	exit using either a far return, or an iret.
David E. Johnson fixed the 3c505 driver.
Joe Doupnik improved HEAD.ASM by adding some comments and he brought it closer
	into compliance with the PDS.  He also changed access_type so that it
	would let driver users ask for all packets even though other driver
	users were asking for some packets.
Joe Doupnik added packet driver support to PC/IP's netwatch.
Many useful subroutines were split out into separate files, rather than
	being duplicated in every program that used them.  These routines
	are in the public domain.
The various packet driver clients (pkt*.com) were changed to use these
	separate files.  They also now use a macro to call the packet driver.
	They also report any and all errors that may occur.  They also ask
	the driver for driver_info, then uses it to access_type.
The packet receive tester, pktall, test to see if the driver is writing too
	much or too little, or in memory that it doesn't own.
SLIP8250 now requires a command-line switch to enable hardware handshake.
TAIL.ASM now prints the arcnet address, if the driver is an arcnet driver.
Jan Engvald improved the wd8003e driver:
The wd8003e driver now supports the E EBT EB ET/A and E/A boards.
The wd8003e memory base default was 0xc400 and is now 0xd000.
The wd8003e driver supports multicast modes.
The wd8003e driver has a better test for occupied memory, and a switch to
	disable the occupied memory test in case it loses.


Changes from version 4.0 to 5.0 of the drivers:

Summary: New: 3c505, ne1000, ni9210, ibmtoken.  Bugs fixed: all drivers.

Krishnan Gopalan and Gregg Stefancik wrote a packet driver for the 3c505.
Brian Fisher wrote an "Ethernet" packet driver for the IBM Token Ring Adapter.
Eric Henderson wrote a packet driver for Novell's NE1000.
Russell Nelson modified ni5210 to be a ni9210 driver.  This entailed some
	changes in 82586.asm.
Russell Nelson wrote pktmode, a utility to set the receive mode.
Russell Nelson wrote pktaddr, a utility to set the Ethernet address.
Russell Nelson wrote pktall, a utility to help debug packet reception.
Trace.com is a little bit more helpful about how to run it.
Vance Morrison added starlan support to the wd8003e driver.
Eric Henderson improved it.
Deborah Swanberg noticed that the 3c503 driver didn't timeout properly
	if there was a failure to complete a transmit.
The set_address routine in the device dependent files now
	returns the address length as it should have.
Head.asm now keeps a copy of the hardware address set by set_address.  This is
	used by f_get_address to return the current address.  The device
	dependent get_address routine always returns the PROM address.
The set_rcv_mode routine didn't work.  Not at all.
The access_type routine returns more appropriate errors.
The f_get_address routine wasn't passing the right address length to
	get_address.
Tail.asm now checks for extra parameters on the end of the line.
Dan Lanciani added changes to ni5210 version 4.2 to increase reliability.
	It works for him.  Unfortunately, I have had reports from other
	people that it breaks Novell.  So, these changes are in "if DAN"
	conditional assembly.  If your Novell connection gets dropped,
	try reassembling ni5210 after setting "DAN equ 0" in 82586.asm
Packet drivers for the NE2000 and UB NIC PC/2 are in the works, but don't
	hold your breath.
A packet driver for the Xircom pocket Ethernet adapter is undergoing testing.
Jan Engvald found and fixed a bug in the wd8003e memory presence check.


Changes from version 3.0 to 4.0 of the drivers:

Russell Nelson added code to enable interrupts in the body of the packet
	driver.
Denis DeLaRoca added hardware handshake to the SLIP8250 driver.
John Grover optimized the SLIP8250 driver to work at 38.4 Kbps.
Russell Nelson added some sanity checking to slip8250 to warn the user about
	possible incorrect parameters.
Bob Clements added a switch to select thick or thin Ethernet in the 3c503.
Russell Nelson found a minor bug in NI5210 that caused it to fail to
	initialize sometimes.  Thanks to everyone who reported it.
Dan Lanciani found a race condition in the 80586 code common to the
	NI5210 and 3c523 drivers.
Russell Nelson split out the 82586 code from the NI5210 and 3c523 drivers
	into a single file.
Russell Nelson added memory address checking to NI5210.
Glen M. Marianko devised a method for determining the memory size of the
	NI5210 automagically.
Jan Engvald enhanced the packet driver code for Western Digital Ethernet
	cards to handle the micro channel version WD8003ET/A.
Jan Engvald enhanced TAIL.ASM to return error codes to DOS.
Jan Engvald enhanced HEAD.ASM to be aware of running on a MicroChannel bus.
Rainer Toebbicke wrote the BICC Data Networks' ISOLAN 4110 ethernet driver.
Russell Nelson wrote the packet driver tracer and dumper (trace.com and
	dump.exe).
Russell Nelson added support for set_rcv_mode, get_rcv_mode,
	set_multicast_list, and get_multicast_list to the infrastructure.  It
	is up to the individuals who wrote the individual drivers to add the
	device-dependent support.


Changes from version 2.0 to 3.0 of the drivers:

GNU General Public License adopted.  The restriction on commercial usage
     prevented some companies from distributing the packet drivers.  This
     is entirely my idea, so send any comments to nelson@clutx.clarkson.edu.
3c523 driver added, thanks to Dan Lanciani (ddl@harvard.edu).
Gregg Stefanik (wstef@eng.clemson.edu) is working on a 3c505 driver.  Don't
     bug him about it unless you're willing to be a alpha tester.
User documentation added (DRIVERS.DOC).
Brad Clements (no relation to Bob Clements) fixed the NI5210 driver so that
     it will work with a MTU of 1500.
The NI5210 now checks for shorts and opens before it starts up, thanks to
     Brad.
All memory-mapped packet drivers now check the packet length in send_pkt to
     ensure that too-long packets get trapped.  All packet drivers will
     work with MTUs of 1500 (plus 14 bytes of Ethernet header).
Deborah Swanberg noticed that attach_type was returning NO_CLASS
     when it meant to return NO_TYPE.
She also noted that packet drivers weren't returning unique handles.  This
     is only a problem with Phil Karn's code, as his code directs *every*
     packet driver to the same receiver routine.  With non-unique handles,
     it was impossible to tell which packet driver was upcalling the
     receiver.  Unique handles are now generated, based on the starting
     segment of the driver.  The latest version of Karn's code uses different
     receiver routines, so the code to implement this will eventually go away.
Tail.asm now prints the Ethernet address of the interface (if it is an Ethernet
     class device)
Micom has sold Interlan, and Racal has bought it, so perhaps the NI5210 is
     now the Racal-Interlan NI5210?
If anyone is interested in using the Zenith Z-100 with a SLIP packet driver, please
     send me (Russell Nelson) mail.  I have it partially written, but will
     probably never use it myself.
WD8003E and 3c503 sped up slightly -- stole movemem from NI5210.


Changes from version 3 to 2.0 of the drivers:

Version numbering now changed.  If the skeleton changes, the major version is
     incremented and all the minor versions are reset to zero.

Support for version 1.08 of the packet driver spec included.
Bob Clements' 3c503 driver added.  See README.503.
Some comments improved.
BAD_COMMAND checking code fixed.
cld instructions added to ensure that DF=0.
NI5210 sped up slightly -- look at movemem in ni5210.asm for an especially
     fast routine to move memory around.


Changes from version 2 to 3 of the drivers:

SLIP8250 can now be one of three classes: SLIP, AX.25, and KISS.
Tail.asm now checks for a packet driver already at the given interrupt.
Tail.asm now echoes its arguments in hex and decimal.
Tail.asm will close stdout so that a file handle won't be used up in
     case the user redirects stdout to NUL.
Head.asm now supports driver termination.
Termin.com added to terminate a driver.
Head.asm now does a stack swap to avoid pushing too many things when
     interrupting MS-LOSS.


Changes from version 1 to 2 of the drivers:

!!  Arguments are now in decimal by default  !!  Use a 0x prefix for hex.

DEFS.ASM created.
The loadport macro improved.
SLIP8250 driver added, thanks for a C version from Phil Karn.
     I've tried to put some 16550 support in, but I don't have one to
     test it with.  The documentation insists the TBRE goes low when
     the transmit buffer is not empty, while it makes sense for it to stay

The two sub-directories contain two separate versions of a driver
for the Parsytec BBK-PC Interface board.  

kpar-version:

  The driver contained in the sub-directory kpar-version is a driver modelled
closely on the kpar driver for the INMOS B008 board, and can only be used
with a board set with

i)	Interrupts 3 or 5
ii)	Base Addresses 0x150, 0x200 or 0x300


real-version:

  The driver contained in the sub-directory real-version is a later version
of the driver which can be configured more closely to the Parsytec BBK-PC
board.  It can be used with

i)	Interrupts 2 to 7
ii)	Base Addresses 0x0000 to 0x0FC0, in steps of 0x20

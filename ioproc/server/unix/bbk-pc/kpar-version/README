Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board
===============================

  Using this driver, the Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board can be configured
with

i)	An interrupt vector of 3 or 5
ii)	A base address of 0x150, 0x200 or 0x300

Note that the BBK-PC cannot use DMA.

  How the device is configured is encoded in the minor device as follows -

bits	0, 1	- should be set to 0
bit	2	- Interrupt Channel: 0 = 3, 1 = 5
bits	3, 4	- Base Address 00 = 0x150
			       01 = 0x200
			       10 = 0x300
			       11 is invalid

For example, to if the device is configured such that it uses IRQ 5
and base address 0x150, the minor device number should be 4 (or binary
00100).

  Using this scheme allows a total of 3 separate device units (from
0 to 2).  The unit number is given by the encoded base address.  (In
the example above, the encoded base address was 0 and hence the unit
number for the device is 0).

Changing the Default Base Address and Interrupt
-----------------------------------------------

  The installation files are currently set up to install the device with
a base address of 150 (and hence a unit number of 0) and interrupt 5.

  To change these defaults, the information in the Node and System files
in the installation directory must be changed.

System:
	The System file is used when building the new kernel.

	Field 4 contains the interrupt number for the device.

	Fields 7 and 8 contain the lower and upper bounds of the address
	range for the device in hexadecimal form.

	For further information, check the manual page 'sdevice'.

Node:
	The Node file is used to create the correct /dev/bbkN device
	(where N is the unit number).  It is also used to specify the
	minor device number, which encodes information for the device
	driver.

	Field 2 contains the name of the node created in /dev, in the form
	bbk<unit-number>.  The unit number can be found by taking the
	encoded base address (ie 0, 1 or 2).

	eg: a base address of 0x200 is encoded as binary 01, and hence field
	    2 becomes bbk1.

	Field 4 contains the minor device number which is used to pass
	information to the device driver.  The encoding for this is given
	above.

	Note that Field 4 is in decimal.

Example:  

  To change the configuration to use Interrupt 3 and base address 0x200.

  The System file becomes

bbk	Y	0	3	3	5	200	220	0	0

  The Node file becomes

bbk	bbk1	c	8

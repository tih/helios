Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board
===============================

  The Parsytec BBK-PC Interface Board can be configured with

i)	An interrupt vector ranging from 2 to 7.
ii)	A base address ranging from 0x0 to 0xFC0. 

Note that the BBK-PC cannot use DMA.

  The BBK-PC driver can be configured to use all the interrupt vectors
and base addresses starting from 0x0 and going up to 0xFC0 in steps of
0x20 (ie 0x0, 0x20, 0x40, ..., 0xFA, 0xFC).  How the device is
configured is encoded in the minor device as follows -

bits	0, 1, 2		- IRQ Number
bits	3 - 10		- Base Address divided by 0x20

For example, to if the device is configured such that it uses IRQ 5
and base address 0x140, the minor device number should be 0x55.
This is equivalent to 00001010101, with the lowest 3 bits being 5 and
the rest being 0xA, which when multiplied by 0x20 equals 0x140 as
required.

  Using this scheme allows a total of 126 separate device units (from
0 to 125).  The unit number is given by the encoded base address.  (In
the example above, the encoded base address was 0xA and hence the unit
number for the device is 10).


Changing the Default Base Address and Interrupt
-----------------------------------------------

  The installation files are currently set up to install the device with
a base address of 140 (and hence a unit number of 10) and interrupt 5.

  To change these defaults, the information in the Node and System files
in the installation directory must be changed.

System:
	The System file is used when building the new kernel.

	Field 4 contains the interrupt number for the device.

	Fields 7 and 8 contain the lower and upper bounds of the address
	range for the device in hexadecimal form.

	For further information, check the manual page 'sdevice'.

Node:
	The Node file is used to create the correct /dev/bbkNNN device
	(where NNN is the unit number).  It is also used to specify the
	minor device number, which encodes information for the device
	driver.

	Field 2 contains the name of the node created in /dev, in the form
	bbk<unit-number>.  The unit number can be found by dividing the
	base address (in hexadecimal) by 0x20, and should be specified in
	decimal.

	eg: a base address of 0x140 gives a hexadecimal unit number of 0xA,
	    and hence field 2 becomes bbk10.

	Field 4 contains the minor device number which is used to pass
	information to the device driver.  The lower 3 bits encode the
	Interrupt number and the upper 8 bits encode the base address
	(divided by 0x20).

	Note that Field 4 is in decimal.

Example:  

  To change the configuration to use Interrupt 3 and base address 0x200.

  The System file becomes

bbk	Y	0	3	3	5	200	220	0	0

  The Node file becomes

bbk	bbk16	c	131

  decimal 131 = hexadecimal 83 = binary 10000011, which encodes the
	Interrupt 		= 011 = decimal 3
	Base Address		= binary 10000 (hexadecimal 10) x 0x20
				= 0x200

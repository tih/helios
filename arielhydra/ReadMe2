Paul,

First, please note that our e-mail is acting up a bit - it seems that
the NIC has forgotten about domain "ariel.com".  Please address e-mail
to us as follows until this problem clears up:

Tim Andre:	master!tpa@rutgers.rutgers.edu
Tony Agnello:	master!ama@rutgers.rutgers.edu
Bob Dillon:	master!rmd@rutgers.rutgers.edu

Here is how to configure the Hydra device driver into your system's
kernel.  I had to make one minor modification to the source I have
already sent to you in order to do this.  The following mail messages
duplicate the source I have already sent to you, with the above
mentioned change made.

I also had to make a minor modification to the COFF loader routine to
correctly read the symbols from COFF files, these new files follow
separately.

Please forgive me if these instructions seem really simple minded, but
I don't know how much you know about configuring a kernel - what I know
about could fit in a thimble.  Feel free to modify it as you see fit.

As I was writing this, I realized there is one problem.  The EPROM file
we sent you has a bad configuration parameter: the address for the
control register is specified as an A-24 address, but the address
modifier is set to A-32.  The Sun won't like this. (The reason for this
is long and arduous, and involves working until 4am and being in
Dallas....)  If you can, connect a dumb terminal to Hydra's RS-232 port
(set for 4800 baud) use the CF HydraMon command to change the address
of the control register to 44000000.  If you can't do this, wait for
Bob Dillon to get there and have him change it.  He can also explain it
better than I can.

I will try to come up with a better solution to this so you can at
least try things out before Bob gets there, but in the meantime you can
perform all of the following procedure, just don't install the board
until Bob has changed the address of the control register.

1) The new files will unpack into a directory called "hydra_cfg".  Copy
these to the kernel configuration area:

	cp -r hydra_cfg /usr/sys/sundev/hydra

2) Create a new kernel configuration file:

	cd /usr/sys/sun3/conf
	cp GENERIC HYDRA

3) Look for interrupt vectors not in use:
	grep vector HYDRA

   On our Sun 3 vectors 0x50, 0x51, 0x52, and 0x53 are unused.

4) Edit the new configuration file, "HYDRA", and add the following line to
its end:

device hydra1 at vme16d32 ? csr 0xf000 priority 2 vector vc_intr 0x50

This line will recognize one Hydra in the system, and all DSPs on this
Hydra will use the same interrtupt vector 0x50.  If you desire to have
each DSP to be assigned its own interrupt vector, then add one line per
DSP.  For example, DSP 2 would be defined as:

device hydra2 at vme16d32 ? csr 0xf000 priority 2 vector vc_intr 0x51

Note that if you had more than one Hydra installed in the system, DSP 1
of the second board would be unit 5, regardless of the number of DSPs
installed on the first board.

5) edit the file "files" in this same directory.  To its end add the lines:

#
# Ariel's Hydra
#
sundev/hydra/vc40cfg.c  	optional	hydra	device-driver
sundev/hydra/vc40top.c  	optional	hydra 	device-driver
sundev/hydra/vc40bottom.c       optional	hydra 	device-driver
sundev/hydra/vc40priv.c 	optional 	hydra 	device-driver

6) Edit /usr/sys/sun/conf.c:

Immediately before the struct cdevsw declaration (which is near the end of the file) add the lines:

/*
 * support for Ariel's Hydra
 */
#include "hydra.h"

#if NHYDRA > 0
int vc40_open(), vc40_close(), vc40_read(), vc40_write(), vc40_ioctl();
int vc40_mmap();

#else
#define	vc40_open	nodev
#define	vc40_close	nodev
#define	vc40_read	nodev
#define	vc40_write	nodev
#define	vc40_ioctl	nodev
#define	vc40_mmap	nodev

#endif


Then, at the end of the cdevsw structure, add the entry for Hydra as:

    {
        vc40_open,      vc40_close,     vc40_read,      vc40_write,     /*105*/
        vc40_ioctl,     nodev,          nodev,          vc40_mmap, 
        0, 0
    },

Note: the index 105 is appropriate for our system, but could be
different for yours.  Whatever it is, remember it for the mknod command
in the next step, as this is the major device number for Hydra.

7) Make the device special entries:

	cd /dev
	mknod vc40a1 c 105 1
	mknod vc40a2 c 105 2
	mknod vc40a3 c 105 3
	mknod vc40a4 c 105 4

	chmod a+rw vc40*

Substitute the appropriate major device number in these commands.

8) Configure and build the new kernel:

	cd /usr/sys/sun3/conf
	config HYDRA
	cd ../HYDRA
	make

9) Install the new kernel, do a test run first:

	cp vmunix /vmunix.new
	sync ; sync ; fasthalt

    At the ">" prompt:
	b vmunix.new -s


When the system finishes booting, you should see the message:

	vc40dsp1 at vme16d32 0xf000 vec 0x50
	vc40dsp: Attached 2-headed Hydra

(assuming that you have the new EPROM programmed correctly).

If you don't have the board installed for the reasons discussed above, 
you will get the message:

	failed to read ICR0

and the system will continue to boot.

10) Make the new kernel permanent:
	mv /vmunix   /vmunix.old
	mv /vmunix.new   /vmunix

	reboot

Paul,

I'm sorry this has taken so long, but at last I can get you started.
The following messages represent the new EPROM in binary format.
Bill Chiechi describes this as follows:

	Binary File for HydraMon:
	
	   HYDRAMON.BIN
	
	Hydra EPROM Type:
	
	   Texas Instrumemts, TMS27C040-15JL
	
	Other 150nS, '27C040 compatible devices should work


More software will follow shortly, as well as the answers to your
questions in the FAX and email I have received.

Tim.

Status: OR

Paul,

The following messages represent the source and stuff to date.  It's not
very clean and needs a bit of work yet, so don't judge me too harshly on
it.

SunOS 4.1.1 for the Sun 3 may not have the same bug that it has for the
Sun 4, so the driver may just work as a loadable driver.

Try this:  after unpacking, go to the hydra/driver directory, do a "make",
and try "vc40load ." as root.  It may just work!

I'll send more instructions tomorrow.

Tim.

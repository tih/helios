Helios 1.2.1 Upgrade Disk
-------------------------

The files just installed are upgrades to the Helios 1.2 distribution. These
upgrades bring Helios to Version 1.2.1 and contain new facilities as well as
fixes to some of the bugs outstanding from Helios 1.2 and earlier.

Major enhancements have been made to the Posix and BSD libraries for
compatability with the Helios Ethernet I package, and the nucleus and network
management software for improved performance on large transputer networks.

A new command appears in 1.2.1 to allow signals to be sent to named tasks. This
is the 'kill' command. The format for kill is :

        kill [-[signum|signam]] taskname
        kill [-[signum|signam]] taskid              (current shell only)
        kill [-[signum|signam]] %<jobnumber>        (current shell only)
        kill -l

where   signum is a valid signal number
        signam is a valid signal name
               ( a list of valid names can be obtained using 'kill -l' )
        taskid is task id number as reported by the shell
        jobnumber is background task number as reported by the 'jobs' command
                  or - for previous background task
                  or % for most recent background task

e.g.
        kill tfm        sends TERM signal to the Task Force Manager
        kill %1         sends TERM signal to first background task
        kill %%         sends TERM signal to most recent background task
        kill 58         sends TERM signal to task with pid 58
        kill -11 fs     sends signal 11 (QUIT) to the file server
        kill -HUP %2    sends HUP signal to second background task

If the task cannot be uniquely identified ( e.g. 'kill shell' when multiple
shells are running), kill will fail. To uniquely identify a task in these
circumstances, use the full task identification as provided by 'ps' e.g.
'kill shell.3' or 'kill /03/tasks/shell.3'.

The rboot and pa_rboot commands have an extra option to allow the user to 
specify the link into which to boot the remote transputer. The command format
is now :

[pa_]rboot [-l<rlink>] <link> <myname> <childname> [<link modes> <memory limit>]

The version of Helios in this directory was last frozen at Helios_1_2_2 on
Wednesday 11th December 1991.

To build a working Helios 1.2.2, the following steps are required:

	1. change directory to makeinc
	2. modify your oem makescript (e.g. makeparsytec for Parsytec,
	   maketelmat for Telmat, etc.) as follows:

		a. change HHOST to the host machine on which the port
		   is taking place. Currently supported hosts are:

			SUN4 - to build Helios on SUN4 machines.
			HELIOSTRAN - to build Helios under Helios.

		b. change hsrc to the root directory of your Helios source
		   tree.

		c. change HPROD to the root directory for Helios binaries

		d. change HHOSTBIN to the bin directory for compilation tools.
		   These are cc, asm, ampp, etc. If your source licence allows,
		   these tools will be built first to ensure that the new
		   version of Helios is built using the latest versions.

	3. change directory to $(HSRC)
	4. run your makescript with the install option
		e.g. makeparsytec install, or
		     maketelmat install.
	5. The whole Helios world should now build itself !!

*** Warning ***

	The Helios make system assumes that you are using GNU make !!!

Helios 1.2.2
------------

Helios 1.2.2 features several enhancements to version 1.2.1 and earlier 
releases of the system. 

New Commands
------------
The following new commands are provided under Helios 1.2.2 :
- access   : display current access rights for named object
- matrix   : display access matrix for named object
- sysbuild : construct Helios nucleus from its components
- sysbreak : split up existing nucleus into its components.

Examples Directory
------------------
A significant number of additional example programs have been included in the
/helios/users/guest/examples directory. These pertain to the use of the 
Resource Management library and servers, as described in "The Helios Parallel 
Operating System", ISBN 0-13-381237-5, Prentice Hall, 1991.

Other fixes
-----------
- setsockopt/getsockopt calls fixed			(bsd)
- asm speed improvements				(asm)
- can't cache directories				(cache)
- taskforces with 16 or 17 components                   (cdl)

- remote generates unique fifo names                    (remote)
- network monitor delay corrected                       (network)

NOTE :
Changes to the Posix read() and write() routines in order to conform to the 
Posix specification have increased the likelihood of partial completion. 
Programs should NOT assume that read()s and write()s have completed if they 
return without error. For portability and Posix compliance, users should 
implement full_read() and full_write() routines which loop until the required 
amount of data has been read or written.

1.2.1
-----

For those sites that did not install the 1.2.1 upgrade disk, a brief summary 
of that upgrade is included below.

Major enhancements have been made to the Posix and BSD libraries for
compatibility with the Helios Ethernet I package, and the nucleus and network
management software for improved performance on large transputer networks.

A new command appears in 1.2.1 to allow signals to be sent to named tasks. This
is the 'kill' command. The format for kill is :

kill [-[signum|signam]] taskname
kill [-[signum|signam]] taskid      (current shell only)
kill [-[signum|signam]] %<jobnumber>(current shell only)
kill -l

where   signum is a valid signal number
signam is a valid signal name
       ( a list of valid names can be obtained using 'kill -l' )
taskid is task id number as reported by the shell
jobnumber is background task number as reported by the 'jobs' command
  or - for previous background task
  or % for most recent background task

e.g.
kill tfmsends TERM signal to the Task Force Manager
kill %1 sends TERM signal to first background task
kill %% sends TERM signal to most recent background task
kill 58 sends TERM signal to task with pid 58
kill -11 fs     sends signal 11 (QUIT) to the file server
kill -HUP %2    sends HUP signal to second background task

If the task cannot be uniquely identified ( e.g. 'kill shell' when multiple
shells are running), kill will fail. To uniquely identify a task in these
circumstances, use the full task identification as provided by 'ps' e.g.
'kill shell.3' or 'kill /03/tasks/shell.3'.

The rboot and pa_rboot commands have an extra option to allow the user to 
specify the link into which to boot the remote transputer. The command format
is now :

[pa_]rboot [-l<rlink>] <link> <myname> <childname> [<link modes> <memory limit>]

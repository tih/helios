# Helios System Configuration File
# This file is interpreted by init to configure the system
# it is NOT a shell script.

# Start up the X server if required
ifabsent /window 	run -e /helios/lib/window window

# Option 1
# Run the network software if necessary, and wait for the Session Manager
# to start up. Then create a console window and register it with the
# Session Manager, which will run login automatically
#run -e /helios/bin/startns startns -r
#waitfor /sm
#console /window console
#run -e /helios/bin/newuser newuser

# Option 2
# Run login by itself without any of the networking software. This gives
# a single-processor single-user system
console /window console
run -e /helios/bin/login login -loop

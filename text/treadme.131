		      Tiny Helios V1.31 Upgrade
		      -------------------------

The changes between the main V1.3 release and the V1.31 upgrade have
been relatively minor. The main ones are as follows:

1) The system's memory requirements have been reduced. The savings
should vary between 50K and 200K on each processor, depending on what
software is loaded.

2) A number of bootstrap problems have been resolved. This will only
affect certain boards.

3) The floating point library has been improved. The new version is
faster and more accurate.

4) The compiler generates more efficient code for stack checking. The
overhead has been reduced from eight words per function to six words.
This may cause problems with application programs that were compiled
with the -l1 pragma: if the linker generates overflow errors when trying
to produce the executable then it will be necessary to eliminate this
pragma.

5) The Windows I/O Server has been improved, and in particular the
graphics support has been largely rewritten. 

6) There is a new public domain directory /helios/local/c40-dma,
contributed by Ken Blackler at the Joint European Torus project. This
directory contains various routines for manipulating C40 dma engines
and links directly.

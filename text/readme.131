			Helios V1.31 Upgrade
			--------------------

The changes between the main V1.3 release and the V1.31 upgrade have
been relatively minor. The main ones are as follows:

1) The system's memory requirements have been reduced. The savings
should vary between 50K and 200K on each processor, depending on what
software is loaded.

2) A number of bootstrap problems have been resolved. This will only
affect certain boards.

3) The floating point library has been improved. The new version is
faster and more accurate.

4) The compiler generates more efficient code for stack checking. The
overhead has been reduced from eight words per function to six words.
This may cause problems with application programs that were compiled
with the -l1 pragma: if the linker generates overflow errors when trying
to produce the executable then it will be necessary to eliminate this
pragma.

5) The rboot command has been extended and it can now be used with
boards that do not have idroms. Instead the relevant idrom information
can be provided in a file, for example:

   rboot -itest.rom -l5 2 /00 /01

This would attempt to boot processor 01 from processor 00. Link 2 of
processor 00 is connected to link 5 of processor 01. The idrom information
is held in the file test.rom. The syntax for such idrom files is the
same as idrom files included in a network resource map.

The main reason for this change is to allow users to boot up small
networks of processor which do not require the full functionality of
the Helios networking software. For further information see sections
2.3.5 and 2.7.4 of "The Helios Parallel Operating System".

6) Also for use with small networks, there are new versions of the login
and remote command called login.sp and remote.nrm respectively.
The standard login and remote commands will work in the absence of the
full Helios networking software but these commands are still linked with
the Resource Management library; therefore they involve a code overhead
of approximately 90K. The login.sp and remote.nrm versions will only work
if the Helios networking software is not running, but they do not
require the Resource Management library.

7) The Windows I/O Server has been improved, and in particular the
graphics support has been largely rewritten. 

8) There is a new public domain directory /helios/local/c40-dma,
contributed by Ken Blackler at the Joint European Torus project. This
directory contains various routines for manipulating C40 dma engines
and links directly.

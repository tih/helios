1008 df format for FSInfo differs from the General Server Protocol format.

1068 alias server name table entries are not deleted.

1099 At most 19 background jobs can be submitted from a single shell.

1158 Helios domain sockets cannot be selected until a read & write
     transaction has been performed.  When starting up a socket,  it
     is therefore necessary to write and read at least one byte before
     using select.

1167 Using idrom syntax in the resource maps means that ALL entries
     in the physical idrom are ignored.  It would be nice to be able
     to reconfigure (say) part of the memory configuration without
     having to get it all correct.  There is no problem if the
     included rom file conatins only disable_cache and/or load_nucleus
     options.

1150 "ls -c" jumbles the columns when filenames are > 19 characters.

 846 "test -d /graphics" crashes the Helios windows I/O Server
     If you need to test for the existance of windows I/O Server,
     use "test -d /msmouse" instead.

1134 ALT F1 (hot key window switching) is sometimes ignored on the PC
     I/O Server

1131 The termination of a pipe is not reliable.
     This has been reported in several ways,  such as ^C not always
     terminating task forces,  or a 20 second delay at the end of
     certain commands involving pipes.

1109 map does not always update task names correctly
     It looks bad but does no harm.

1049 Shell does not sort wildcard expansions e.g. cat x?? does not
     guarantee that xaa will be displayed before xab

1039 cp aborts if it finds am invalid file name. Instead it should
     warn and continue with other arguments.

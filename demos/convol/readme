Pictures phobos1, phobos2 are length-encoded,
using the following format :
   2 bytes giving the height of the picture
   2 bytes giving the width of the picture
   escape sequences introduced by a byte 0x00FF, and then
    a 2 byte length, and the value to be expanded
   other bytes without encoding

For example, the following binary file,

  02000200   00010203 ff000810 ff0001ff

would be the start of a picture 512 * 512 pixels, which expands to

  00 01 02 03 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ff

The lines wrap around. Thus if most of the top of a picture or the
bottom of a picture is blank then several lines can be encoded in
a single sequence.

The program encode.c takes a 512*512 picture and encodes it. The
program decode.c does the inverse operation. The programs hist.c
and length.c may be used to obtain statistics about typical
lengths of sequences and about the frequencies of bytes.

The programs convol.cdl and master.c and slave.c are a convolution 
example from "The Helios parallel programming tutorial".

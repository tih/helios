			Owners
			======

  This little program tells you who is currently logged on, how many
processors everybody is using, and so on. Typical output produced is
something like :

system    :   1 processors,  7% of the network
free pool :   1 processors,  7% of the network
bart      :   5 processors, 35% of the network
jon       :   7 processors, 50% of the network

The way the program works is as follows. After some initialisation the
program calls RmGetNetwork(). This routine contacts the network
server and asks for details of the whole network. The network server
will send the details to this program, where it will use up lots of
memory.

Once the network has been read in it is examined. This is done by
applying a function, NetworkWalk(), to every processor in the network.
The function extracts the current owner of each processor and attempts
to match it with the list of currently known owners. If the owner
is already known then the count is updated. Otherwise a new structure
is added to the list of known users, with an initial count of one for
the current processor.

Once all of the network has been examined the results must be output
somehow. This requires mapping the integer owner details onto names,
and there is a library routine RmWhoIs() to do that.

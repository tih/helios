	Resource Management Library Example Programs
	============================================

  This directory contains various example programs which illustrate the use
of the Resource Management library, and may serve as the basis for
users' own application software. All programs come complete with an
explanatory file, extensive comments, and a makefile.

owners
======
	This program examines the current network and works out which
users own how many processors. It illustrates basic use of the library
routines such as RmApplyNetwork().

buildrm
=======
	This program builds a network resource map in either binary or text
form. It assumes that the network consists of a single I/O processor, a
root processor, and an x by y grid. The various arguments specify the size
of the network and the hardware-specific device drivers to use.

mappipe
=======
	This program is used to map a pipeline of programs on to a network,
and attempts to illustrate the use of the Resource Management library
for mapping taskforces onto networks.

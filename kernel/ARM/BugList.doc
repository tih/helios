Helios-ARM BugList
------------------
P.A.Beskeen March '93


Overrun and other conditions detailed in smc documentation
(/hsrc/tcpip/drivers/pidether/smc.pc.code/690notes.doc)
must be taken care of in the ethernet driver. This only copes with ring
overflow error condition currently.

RS232 hardware handshake must be implemented. 

FTP crashes after transferring a file - no exception message!

Free has strange block shown at top.

ports regularly falls over when printing freeQ.

map has shown a 'z' appearing and disappearing in bottom right corner - this
bug has now disappeared.

c/cc crashes with simple -help.

SVC mode exceptions do not print a backtrace.

Not sending an environment (initrc run not -e) to window server causes
initrc to crash.

As with other CPU's map can occasionally fall over in showpools as this
is not protected from the system.

Archi doesn't boot Helios if link podule is not in slot 0.

makesystem doesn't install native window server in /hprod/ARM/lib.

didn't get 20Mb link adapter running on archi for no apparent reason - try
again when more time.

See strange 'Y' task in 'free' program's output.

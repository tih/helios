Add hardware handshake for rs232.

Make sure the latest version on disk of the archi bootstrap is backed up
in kernel/ARM/archiboot.

Add poll_delay(Usecs); function - for very short timed delays. - doesn't place
thread on timer Q, but loops for the relevant period. - depending on processor
this can have a different multiplier to get approx time delay required.

CPU indentification code required: arm2/3/60/600 - GetCPUType in gexec.h and
then login.c.

Add select to native window server (allows keyboard input for rlogin/telnet)
- see code in tty server.

Add MSR/MRS ARM6 instruction support to objdump/disasarm.

Add FPE support

Keyboard server.

XLib.

Archimedes X Server.

Archimedes bootstrap from floppy.

Ethernet LANCE driver for Archi.

Use of new ARM Ltd tools (loads o' work).


32 bit changes required:

	Check for use of teqP in sources.

	NewWorker needs way of specifying 32bit SVC mode to CreateProcess.

	All assembler	'movs	pc, lr' need to be checked for conformance
	with new PCS.

	All Exception handlers should be updated.

	Need CPU indentification sequence for places where binary compatibility
	is impossible.

	All changes to flags should be use read/modify/write strategy.

	IRQDispatch corrupts high bits of PC return address.

	Check all __ARM6 comments and warnings.


Clean ups required:

	Properly though out exception handlers for ARM6.

	Suss out PLATFORM SPECIFIC! limits like (MAX?) COMMSLINKS defined in
	armexec.h - MUST be fixed for platorm independence, also check where
	this is used in kstart.c.

	Building different nuclei for different platforms should create
	different named nuclei.

	Native window server should implement device driver interface and
	save and restore attributes.

	PID panic button should be a way of displaying the current threads
	context info (as in an exception condition).

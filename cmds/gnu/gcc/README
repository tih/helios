This directory contains subdirectories for the gcc benchmark source (src/) and
binaries (bin/). It also contains gcc.nroff, a specification document for the
benchmark that can be printed using "troff gcc.nroff".

The gcc benchmark is based around the GNU gcc 1.35 compiler.
The benchmark consists of two steps:

	1) Compile gcc on your machine using the instructions given
	   in the README in the src directory.

	2) Run the benchmark using the instructions given in the
	   README in the bin directory.

The results appear in a file called res/gcc.time.

The following steps amplify on the above:

	a) Port gcc 1.35 to the machine to be benchmarked. (See
	   the README in the src directory).
	   Note that gcc is set up to generate MC68020 (Sun-3)
	   assembly code and not executables for the machine to be
	   benchmarked.

	b) Compile gcc with the highest degree of optimization
	   available on your machine. Any source code changes needed
	   for this purpose should be propagated back to Sun Microsystems
	   for inclusion in the release tape.

	c) Run the benchmark by using the script Run-gcc in the
	   bin directory.  This script uses the gcc compiled in
	   the step above to compile a set of preprocessed (.i)
           C files in the bin directory into assembly (.s) files. (See
           the README in the bin directory). It also verfies that the
	   assembly output is correct by using the diff command.

	d) Run-gcc creates a res directory and inserts the compile
	   times into a file called gcc.time in that directory.

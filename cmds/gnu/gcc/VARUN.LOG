Linked `config.h' to `config/xm-m68k.h'.
Linked `tm.h' to `config/tm-sun3.h'.
Linked `md' to `config/m68k.md'.
Linked `aux-output.c' to `config/out-m68k.c'.
Links are now set up for use with a sun3.

module recog_6 was not compiled with optimization since I used
a Olimit of 1000 and not >= 1180.
All .o files were compiled with -O2 all a.out's were compiled
with -O3. I tried the -O3 -j option for all .u files but cc1
linking crashed in umerge. See Make.log.hoth

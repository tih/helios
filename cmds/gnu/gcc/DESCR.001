\fB1.  GENERAL
.br
1.1.  Classification\fR
.in +4
\fIgcc\fR is a CPU intensive benchmark written in C.  It spends 2% to 5% of
its total execution time performing disk I/O on a Sun-4.  About 0.015% of all
instructions executed on a Sun-4 are floating point.
.in -4
\fB1.2  Description\fR
.in +4
\fIgcc\fR is based on the GNU C compiler version 1.35 distributed by the Free
Software Foundation. The benchmark measures the time it takes for the GNU
C compiler to convert a number of its pre-processed source files into
optimized Sun-3 assembly language (.s files) output.
.in -4
\fB1.3  Source/Author\fR
.in +4
The \fIgcc\fR benchmark is sponsored by Sun Microsystems Inc..  It is derived
from the GNU C compiler written principally by Richard Stallman of the Free
Software Foundation.
.in -4
\fB1.4  Version/Date\fR
.in +4
Benchmark Version 1.0,    Date 5/18/89.
.in -4
\fB1.5  Other Information\fR
.in +4
The benchmark unloads from tape into a directory called \fIgcc1.35\fR.
There are two sub-directories \fIsrc\fR and \fIbin\fR beneath
this.  After running the benchmark a third sub-directory \fIres\fR will be
created.
This benchmark has been tested on a Sun-4, a DECstation 3100 and a MIPS
M/2000 machine.  Please email \fInvc@sun.com\fR to report problems or to request
further information.
.in -4
.sp
\fB2.  PERFORMANCE\fR
.br
\fB2.1.  Metrics\fR
.in +4
The metric used is the elapsed (real) time as output by \fI/bin/time\fR.
This is the time that the GNU C compiler takes to compile 19
pre-processed source files into assembly files.
.in -4
\fB2.2.  Elapsed Time\fR
.in +4
As above.
.in -4
\fB2.3.  Reports\fR
.in +4
The output of \fI/bin/time\fR is directed to \fIgcc.time\fR
in the sub-directory \fIgcc1.35/res\fR.  The benchmark creates a number of
assembly language output files.  These output files are compared with a
set of reference files in the directory \fIgcc1.35/bin/sun-68k-sfiles\fR.
.in -4
.bp
\fB2.4  Additional Performance Considerations\fR
.in +4
\fIgcc\fR is mainly an integer benchmark.  However, it does contain a very small amount
of I/O and floating point computation.  On a Sun-4/260 system the disks are
busy about 2% of the total run time of the benchmark.  About 0.01% of the
instructions on a Sun-4/260 are floating point.The benchmark is run 5 times
by default to help eliminate distortions due to
variance.  The arithmetic mean of the elapsed time of all the runs should be
reported as the performance metric.  The variance in execution
times is much lower than 5% among successive runs of the benchmark.  We
recommend that the benchmark be run on a system in single user mode or one with
a low load average to ensure repeatability of results.
.in -4
.sp
\fB3.  SOFTWARE\fR
.br
\fB3.1  Language\fR
.in +4
The \fIgcc\fR benchmark is written in C.
.in -4
\fB3.2  Operating System\fR
.in +4
The benchmark has been run on Unix System V and BSD 4.3 based operating
systems.
.in -4
\fB3.3  Portability\fR
.in +4
Installation of the GNU C compiler is system dependent.  We have tried to
minimize the amount of reconfiguration required to run the benchmark on
different machines and operating systems.
.br
The native compilers on some machines may not be able to compile the GNU C
compiler without a change in the source code.  We request that these changes be
propagated back to \fInvc@sun.com\fR.  The machines we tested the benchmark on
compiled the GNU C compiler with some warning messages.  Examples of the
output of the compilation may be found in the files
\fIgcc1.35/src/Make.log.*\fR.
.in -4
\fB3.4  Vectorizability/Multi-Processor Issues\fR
.in +4
\fIgcc\fR code is not easily vectorizable.
.in -4
\fB3.5  Miscellaneous Software\fR
.in +4
The benchmark requires the presence of the Unix utilities  \fIcat, cp, diff,
ln, rm, mv, sh\fR and \fItime\fR.
.in -4
\fB3.6  Known Bugs\fR
.in +4
Since this benchmark is highly system dependent, it may fail on some machines.
We have attempted to fix most problems, however, not all warning messages have
been suppressed.
.in -4
\fB3.7  Additional Software Considerations\fR
.in +4
None.
.in -4

\fB4.  HARDWARE\fR
.br
\fB4.1  Memory\fR
.in +4
The dynamic memory requirements of this benchmark have not been ascertained,
however, it should fit on an 8MB system with little or no paging.  The static
size of the executable modules \fIgcc\fR and \fIcc1\fR on a Sun-4 are as
follows:
.nf

\fB5.  OPERATIONAL\fR
.br
\fB5.1  Disk Space\fR
.in +4
\fIgcc\fR takes up about 8 MB of space on tape. The source and
executables require about 15 MB of disk space.

\fB5.2  Installation\fR
.in +4
Extract using tar. There are makefiles and README's provided in each directory.
There is a generic Makefile called \fIgcc1.35/src/Makefile.orig\fR.  There are
also sample makefiles for the Sun-4, MIPS and the DECstation 3100.  System
specific options may be included in the CFLAGS variable.
At present, the only system specific configuration
activity required is to link \fIgcc1.35/src/config.h\fR to
\fIgcc1.35/src/config/xm-m68k.h\fR for Unix 4.3 BSD based systems (default
setting) or to \fIgcc1.35/src/config/xm-hp9k320.h\fR for Unix System V
systems.  While this has worked on the machines we have tested, there may be
some machines and operating systems that will require more
work.  The user should read the file \fIgcc1.35/src/INSTALL\fR in such
situations.
.in -4
\fB5.3  Execution\fR
.in +4
To execute the benchmark type the following:
.nf
\fL
hostname% cd gcc1.35/bin
hostname% Run-gcc
.fi
\fR
The script \fIRun-gcc\fR will create a directory called \fIgcc1.35/res\fR.
This directory will contain two files \fIgcc.time\fR and \fIgcc.log\fR.
\fIgcc.time\fR contains the output of \fI/bin/time\fR for each iteration.
\fIgcc.log\fR contains the results of a diff between the compiled assembly
files and the reference files.
It will be empty if there are no differences.
.br
.in -4
\fB5.4  Correctness Verification\fR
.in +4
This done by the script \fIRun-gcc\fR during its first iteration.  A message is
printed to the console either confirming or denying that there are any
differences.  The reference assembly files, against which checking is done,
are stored in \fIgcc1.35/bin/sun-68k-sfiles\fR.
.in -4
\fB5.5  Additional Operational Considerations\fR
.in +4
None.

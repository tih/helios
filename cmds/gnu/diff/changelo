	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Bug fix in context handling,
	introduced by last change.

Fri Jul 14 17:39:20 1989  Chris Hanson  (cph at kleph)

	* analyze.c: To make RCS work correctly on files that don't
	necessarily end in newline, introduce some changes that cause
	diffs to be sensitive to missing final newline.  Because
	non-RCS modes don't want to be affected by these changes, they
	are conditional on `output_style == OUTPUT_RCS'.
	(diff_2_files) [OUTPUT_RCS]: Suppress the "File X missing
	newline" message.
	(build_script) [OUTPUT_RCS]: Cause the last line to compare as
	different if exactly one of the files is missing its final
	newline.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_each_line): Bug fix in
	ignore_space_change mode.  Change line's length to include the
	newline.  For OUTPUT_RCS, decrement last line's length if
	there is no final newline.
	(find_identical_ends) [OUTPUT_RCS]: If one of the files is
	missing a final newline, make sure it's not included in either
	the prefix or suffix.

	* util.c (print_1_line): Change line output routine to account
	for line length including the newline.

Tue Jun 27 02:35:28 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Inserted $(archpfx) where appropriate.

Wed May 17 20:18:43 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff3.c [USG]: Include fcntl.h.

	* diff.h [USG]: New compilation flags HAVE_NDIR, HAVE_DIRECT.

Wed Apr 26 15:35:57 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* dir.c (diff_dirs): Two new args, NONEX1 and NONEX2, say to pretend
	nonex dirs are empty.
	(dir_sort): New arg NONEX, likewise.
	* diff.c (compare_files): Pass those args.
	Sometimes call diff_dirs if subdir exists in just one place.

Wed Apr 12 01:10:27 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Set END0 *after* last char
	during backward scan for suffix.

Sat Apr  8 15:49:49 1989  Randall Smith  (randy at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff3.c (using_to_diff3_block): Now find high marks in files 1
	and 2 through mapping off of the last difference instead of the
	first.

	* diff3.c: Many trivial changes to spelling inside comments. 

Fri Feb 24 12:38:03 1989  Randall Smith  (randy at gluteus.ai.mit.edu)

	* util.c, normal.c, io.c, ed.c, dir.c, diff.h, diff.c, context.c,
	analyze.c, Makefile: Changed copyright header to conform with new
	GNU General Public license.
	* diff3.c: Changed copyright header to conform with new GNU
	General Public license.
	* COPYING: Made a hard link to /gp/rms/COPYING.

Fri Feb 24 10:01:58 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (slurp): Leave 2 chars space at end of buffer, not one.
	(find_identical_ends): Special case if either file is empty;
	don't try to make a sentinel since could crash.

Wed Feb 15 14:24:48 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff3.c (message)  Re-wrote routine to avoid using alloca()

Wed Feb 15 06:19:14 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Delete the variable `bytes'.

Sun Feb 12 11:50:36 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* io.c (slurp): ->bufsize is nominal amount we have room for;
	add room for sentinel when calling xmalloc or xrealloc.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Do need overrun check in finding suffix.

Fri Feb 10 01:28:15 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.c (main): -C now takes arg to specify context length.
	Now -p to show C function name--Damned IEEE!
	Fatal error if context length spec'd twice.

	* ed.c (print_ed_hunk): Now special treatment only for lines containing
	precisely a dot and nothing else.  Output `..', end the insert,
	substitute that one line, then resume the insert if nec.

	* io.c (find_and_hash_lines): When backing up over starting context,
	don't move past buffer-beg.

	* io.c (find_identical_ends): Use sentinels to make the loops faster.
	If files are identical, skip the 2nd loop and return quickly.
	(slurp): Leave 1 char extra space after each buffer.

	* analyze.c (diff_2_files): Mention difference in final newlines.

Wed Jan 25 22:44:44 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* dir.c (diff_dirs): Use * when calling fcn ptr variable.

Sat Dec 17 14:12:06 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: New vars INSTALL and LIBS used in some rules;
	provide default defns plus commented-put defns for sysV.

Thu Nov 17 16:42:53 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* dir.c (dir_sort): Open-trouble not fatal; just say # files is -1.
	(diff_dirs): If dir_sort does that, give up and return 2.

	* diff.c (compare_files): Don't open directories.
	Don't close them specially either.
	Cross-propagate inf[i].dir_p sooner.

Sun Nov 13 11:19:36 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* diff.h: Declare index, rindex.

	* diff.c (compare_files): If comparing foodir with b/f,
	use foodir/f, not foodir/b/f.

	* diff.c (compare_files): Don't print "are identical" msg for 2 dirs.
	Status now 1 if one file is a dir and the other isn't, etc.

Thu Nov  3 16:30:24 1988  Randall Smith  (randy at gluteus.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Added a define for diff3 to define DIFF_PROGRAM.

	* util.c: Added hack to make sure that perror was not called with
	a null pointer.

	* diff.c: Changed S_IFDIR to S_IFMT in masking type of file bits
	out. 

	* diff3.c: Included USG compatibility defines.

	* diff.h: Moved sys/file.h into #else USG section (not needed or
	wanted on System V).

	* ed.c, analyze.c, context.c: Shortened names to 12 characters for
	the sake of System V (too simple not to do).

Gawk has been compiled and (very) minimally tested under MS-DOS using
MSC 5.1.  To compile under DOS, move the stuff in the pc directory to
the directory with the rest of the gawk sources, and run make.bat.
The Makefile.pc file is obsolete and should probably go away.

You will have to put CRs at the end of each line in make.bat.

You will have to copy the Microsoft library routine setargv.obj to
the gawk directory for the link to work

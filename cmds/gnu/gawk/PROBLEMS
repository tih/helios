This is a list of known problems in gawk 2.13.
Hopefully they will all be fixed in the next major release of gawk.

Please keep in mind that the code is still undergoing significant evolution.

1. Gawk's error messages are not in GNU standard format (not emacs parseable).

2. Gawk's printf is probably still not POSIX compliant.

When compiling on DECstation running Ultrix 4.0 a command 'cc -c -O
regex.c' is causing an infinite loop in an optimizer.  Other sources
compile fine with -O flag.  If you are going to use this flag either
add a special rule to Makefile for a compilation of regex.c, or issue
'cc -c regex.c' before hitting 'make'.

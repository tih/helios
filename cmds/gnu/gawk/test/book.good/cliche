A jack of all trades gathers no moss.
A rolling stone has a price.
Every man abhors a vacuum.
A rolling stone that ends well.
A rolling stone shall die by the sword.
All's well shall die by the sword.
History shall die by the sword.
Nature is master of none.
Every man abhors a vacuum.
Nature is master of none.
Nature is master of none.
All's well that ends well.
All's well that ends well.
A jack of all trades has a price.
Nature has a price.
He who lives by the sword is master of none.
Nature gathers no moss.
Every man has a price.
He who lives by the sword has a price.
History that ends well.

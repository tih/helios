These programs are almost unchanged from what is available via 
netlib@research.att.com.  They are taken from:

	The AWK Programming Language. Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger,
	Addison-Wesley, 1988.  ISBN 0-201-07981-X

and are copyright material (see COPYRIGHT).

The availability of these programs has been invaluable in testing gawk
and we thank Brian Kernighan for permission to use them.

NEXT[Advanced Text Editing] PREV[Advanced Text Editing]

	MicroEMACS lets you create your own programs to perform any editing
	tasks, simple or complex. These macros are normally stored in files
	with a .CMD extension.

	In an effort to get this version of MicroEMACS out, this section
	of the help system is not yet complete. For information on writing
	these macros and command pages, look in the MicroEMACS reference
	manual, and look at the .CMD files supplied as the default
	environment for MicroEMACS.

	Emacs.rc (or .emacsrc under UNIX) is the file which is executed
	automatically whenever MicroEMACS is started. Newpage.cmd is the
	command page loader, and all the ?page.cmd files contain the
	code for each page. Ehelp.cmd contains the macro to run this
	help system.




=>Using the Mouse
NEXT[More Mousing] PREV[Main Menu]

	On some systems, MicroEMACS can use the mouse to perform many
	basic editing tasks. If your platform and MicroEMACS support the
	mouse you can do any of these operations. (Mouse behavior can be
	changed inside a macro, like this help system, so try these
	AFTER you exit from HELP).

	Repositioning the POINT

		Move the mouse to where you want the point to be, and click
		once with the left mouse button and release. The point will
		move there, making any screen or window active to do so.

	Scrolling text inside a window

		Position the mouse to the text to drag, press the left button,
		move the mouse to where to display the text (horizontally
		or vertically), and release the mouse button.

	Moving a Modeline

		Position the mouse any any modeline except the last, press
		the left button, move to another position and release the
		button. The modeline will move, resizing the windows which
		are above and below.

	Copy a region

		Position the mouse at the beginning of the region to copy,
		press the right button, move the mouse to the end of the
		region, release the button.

	Kill a region

		After copying a region, without moving the mouse, click the
		right mouse button once. The text will disappear.

	Pasting Cut Text

		Move anywhere away from the place the text was deleted,
		and click the right button once. The last text placed in the
		kill buffer will be inserted.

	Resizing the current screen

		Move the mouse to the last position of the command line.
		Press the left button down. Move the mouse to a new place
		for the lower right corner of the current screen and release.

	Moving the current screen

		Move the mouse to the upper left of the screen, Press down
		the left button. Move to a new position and release the
		button. The screen will move to the new position.

	Create a New Screen

		Move to the upper left corner of any existing screen. Press
		down on the left mouse button. Move to a new position and
		release the button. A new screen containing the buffer
		current in the old will appear with the same size as the
		copied screen.

	Deleting a Screen

		Click once on the command line of a screen with the right
		mouse button. It will disappear. If it is the only screen
		visible, MicroEMACS will exit.

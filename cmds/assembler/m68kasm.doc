Motorola 68000 Helios Assembler.

P.A.Beskeen
June '93


The current assembler support all of the standard Helios directives, but
NO mnemonics! It has been made available to provide a low cost route to
port Helios to the 68k. 68k machine code can be included by use of 'word'
directives with the machine code encoded as hex constants.

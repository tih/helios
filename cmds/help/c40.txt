*n AllocSpecial\System library
*P Allocates memory from one of the special memory pools
*I <memory.h>
*F Carrier *AllocSpecial( word size, word type, Pool *pool );
*A %ssize%s - Size of memory to allocate
*A %stype%s - Type of memory to allocate
*A %spool%s - Pointer to pool that is to receive the allocated block
*R Pointer to a RAM carrier structure, or NULL
*D This function allocates memory from one of the special memory pools
which may exist. NULL is returned if the requested memory cannot be allocated.
The %btype%b field indicates which special pool the
memory should be allocated from: it is a bitwise OR of the
following property flags:
*c=RAMType_Dynamic         Slower or dynamic RAM.
*c=
*c=RAMType_Static          Faster or static RAM.
*c=
*c=
*c=RAMType_Direct          Directly addressable from C programs.
*c=
*c=RAMType_Indirect        Only addressable via machine pointers.
*c=
*c=
*c=RAMType_Local           Memory is on local processor Bus.
*c=
*c=RAMType_Global          Memory is on global processor Bus.
*p Only one option from each pair should be given. Note that memory which
is denoted %bGlobal%b is not necessarily shared with other processors. If 
an option from one of the pairs is not selected, %bAllocSpecial%b
defaults to the first option defined for each pair.
*p For compatibility, the %bAllocFast()%b function is equivalent to 
%bAllocSpecial()%b for %bStatic/Direct/Local%b type RAM. 
*p %bAllocSpecial%b will only allocate memory that is not being used for the
standard memory allocator. Usually all local RAM (except for on-chip
RAM) is used by the standard allocator, and can be accessed by means of
the various Helios memory allocation functions such as %bmalloc%b.
*p The result of this function is a pointer to a %bCarrier%b structure:
*c=struct Carrier {
*c=      MPtr		Addr;	/* Machine pointer of RAM block		*/
*c=      Size		Size;	/* Size of RAM block			*/
*c=      Word		Type;	/* Type of memory in RAM block		*/
*c=};
*p The %bAddr%b field will always be a machine address, which may be converted
into a normal data pointer only if the memory has the %bDirect%b property.
*p The %bsize%b argument to %bAllocSpecial()%b and the %bSize%b field of the
carrier both indicate the memory block's size in multiples of it's
allocation unit. On the Transputer this will always be in bytes, but on the
C40 this is a %bword%b count.
*p Special memory may be freed by passing the carrier pointer to %bFreeMem()%b.

*l d
*t forces all external calls from the module to indirect through the module
   table.  Also forces the generation of %bcodetable%b directives and codetable
   initialization code.
*l f
*t suppresses insertion of function names in code image (reduces the output
   information  given by %b_backtrace()%b and %b_mapstore()%b if an untrapped
   exception occurs but typically saves 5 per cent of code size).
*l h
*t for policing software quality requirements: requires all %bextern%b function

*n rboot\Helios command
*q rboot, network command
*P Boots a c40 processor by hand.
*F rboot [-l<link>] <link> <myname> <childname> [<link modes> <memory limit>]
*D The %brboot%b command is used to boot up processors by
   hand, usually when the network is too small to warrant running all of the
   networking software. The command must be executed on an active processor
   adjacent to the one being booted. The first argument specifies the link
   used for the bootstrap, an integer between 0 and 5 in the case of C40s.
   The second argument is
   the name of the processor doing the booting. The third argument is the
   name of the processor being booted. Then there are two optional arguments:
   %slink modes%s and %smemory limit%s. The %slink modes%s argument specifies the modes
   of the four links of the newly booted processor: 0 means not connected; 1
   means dumb; 2 means intelligent and active; 3 means intelligent but
   pending. The final argument is rarely required: it specifies the amount of
   memory to be used on the newly booted processor. This option is necessary
   if the target processor has some memory mapped hardware such as video
   memory adjacent to normal memory, which could cause the kernel to use that
   video memory for memory allocation. For example, if the processor has one
   megabyte of normal memory immediately followed by one megabyte of video
   memory, a size of 0x1000000 could be used.
*p If the target processor is being booted through any link other than its
   link 0, it is necessary to specify the target link. For example,
   if processor 00 link 2 goes to processor 01 link 1, the command
   to boot processor 01 is:
*c= rboot -l1 2 /00 /01
*p Note that the C40 must have an ID ROM for this command to work.

machine address (see %bMP_LinkOut()%b
for details on how to transfer data to a link). An error result is
returned if %slink%s is invalid, the link is not in DUMB mode, or the
transfer took more than the given time. The link should have been
previously reserved with %bAllocLink()%b.

this timeout to a multiple of one second, with a minimum timeout of two
seconds.

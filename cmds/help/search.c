 *	This routine supports deletion.  When the user supplies a key to

 *	Parameters:

 *		key -- key to find
 *
 *	Returns:
 *		The BTITEM for the matching item.  If there's no match,
 *		this may point to the first item > than the supplied key,
 *		or off the end of the page.
 *
 *	Warnings:
 *		The BTITEM returned is in static space and will be overwritten
 *		by the next search of any kind in any btree.

 *  _BT_BINSRCH -- Do a binary search for a given key on the current page.
 *
 *	Searches on internal pages are handled slightly differently from
 *	searches on leaf pages.  This is because internal page searches
 *	find the largest item <= key in the tree, and leaf searches find
 *	the smallest item >= key.  This guarantees that leaf page searches
 *	leave us pointing at the item's correct position, and internal
 *	searches descend the tree correctly.
 *
 *	Parameters:
 *		t -- tree to search
 *		key -- key we're looking for
 *
 *	Returns:
 *		Index of the line pointer array entry for the (closest)
 *		match to key on the current page, with "closest" as defined
 *		above.

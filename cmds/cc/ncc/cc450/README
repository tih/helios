cfe   -  Sources for the Codemist C front end
util  -  Sources for utlities occaisionally used by the compiler builders.

c40   -  Sources for the C40 code generator
68k   -  Sources for the 68K code generator

C40   -  Binaries of the C40 hosted C40 C compiler
M68K  -  Binaries of the 68K hosted 68K C compiler

RS6000 - Binaries of the RS6000 hosted C40, or 68K C compiler
SUN4   - Binaries of the Sparc  hosted C40, or 68K C compiler
HP     - Binaries of the HP9000 hosted C40, or 68K C compiler


The makefile is set up to work with the Helios make system.  To build
the following programs use the following commands :-

Program					Command
-------					-------
IBM hosted C40 C compiler (ccc40)	makers6000
IBM hosted 68K C compiler (ccm68k)	makers6000m68k or makeRS6000

Helios-C40 hosted C40 C compiler (ncc)	makec40
Helios-68K hosted 68K C compiler (ncc)	makem68k


Note/ Only one version of the IBM hosted C compiler can be held in the
RS6000 directory.  If you try to build a version for another target
machine, the old binaries will be replaced.

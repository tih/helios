Fri Feb 21 14:52:58 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(conditional_load_float): Added code to cope with unsigned FLOAT
	and signed and unsigned FIX, rather than letting the compiler
	generating the code.

Thu Feb 20 10:20:24 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(load_static_data_ptr): Added code to shift assignments to address
	registers back a few instructions in the hope of avoiding pipeline
	conflicts. 
	
	(convert_to_C40_format): Added code to support floating point (as
	opposed to double precision) operations using immediate values.
	As a result the FP code has been streamlined.

	Added several improvements to the peepholer, all based on the code
	being produced for the Dhrystone benchmark.  Also fixed the code
	to load and store bytes and shorts, in order to avoid pipeline
	conflicts.

Wed Feb 19 14:49:12 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(show_instruction): added code to do manual sign extensions and
	enabled TARGET_HAS_SIGN_EXTEND.

Wed Feb 12 11:30:58 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(float_immediate_op): Added code to handle immediate double
	precision operations, and enabled TARGET_HAS_FP_LITERALS.

Thu Feb  6 14:29:57 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* asm.c
	(decode_triadic_address): improved decoding of unsigned immediate
	values. 

	* gen.c
	Added pragma (n) to disable peepholing.
	Compile programs -zpn1 for this feature.

Wed Feb  5 11:32:44 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(flush_pending_pushes): fixed order of flushing pending pushes and
	adding multiple pushes in the first place.

Tue Feb  4 13:47:14 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(add_pending_push): added code to handle pushing and poping floats
	and doubles.

Fri Jan 31 18:02:30 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(compare_integer): fixed test against large numbers.

Tue Jan 28 12:46:12 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* disas.c
	(decode_short_float): same change as for asm.c

	* asm.c
	(decode_short_float): added this function to decode the short
	floating point C40 format.

Mon Jan 27 10:30:11 1992  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* gen.c
	(non_word_op): fixed stores via word pointer to generate correct
	op code.

Thu Aug 22 17:59:10 1991  Nick Clifton  (nickc at snake)

	* Changed register scheme so that R0-R3 are argument
	registers, (R3 is no longer a temporary register used by the back
	end), R4 - R7 are variable registers, and R8 - R10, BK are
	temporary register,  The repeat engine registers are now being used
	as temporary registers.

	* First log entry.
	This is an attempt to document more fully the work that I am
	doing in order to port this compiler to the C40.  This is a
	direct result of the company's policy to improve Q&A.

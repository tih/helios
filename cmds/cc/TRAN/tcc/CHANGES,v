mip/*.h:
cfe/*.h:
	string pragmas surrounded by #ifndef __OLD_HELIOS_CC during porting
	For cc350 - use Nick C's USE_NORCROFT_PRAGMAS instead

mip/host.h:
	LIBRARY_IS_NORCROFT switched off for Helios host

cfe/vargen.c:
	call to codeloc() in initstaticvar made CLIPPER-dependent, it only
	appears to be necessary in that case, my codeloc() assigns a new
	label each time it is called.
	For cc350 this is no longer needed - vargen not changed.

cfe/vargen.h:
	In cc350 there appears to be a type mismatch between the prototype
	of genstaticparts() in this file and its definition in vargen.
	This is only a matter of a missing const - but it is a Serious error.

cfe/syn.c:
	widening of function formals removed for TRANSPUTER code


NICE:
	initialize initialized auto structs & arrays out of literal pool
	rather than static data area, just like strings.

=============

New options recognized
         -zl        ready for whatever it has to do - at present
                    behaves exactly as -zr
         -zs        enable split module tables (incomplete support thus far)


(B1) Fixed, I hope
(B2) Fixed - but it was to do with delicate decisions as to whether
     references were to code or data, so it MAY now be that some refs
     that ought to go to code now go to data.
(B3) I think this is mostly a linker issue, but have not checked
     everywhere in the compiler yet.
(B4) As discussed - the auto init is done via a memcpy from an
     anonymous static array, and with -zr the static array does not
     get set up by the C compiler - it is the responsibility of whoever
     is building the library.  I would like to view this is a -zr
     restriction for now.
(B5) Initialisation of floating point vars had not been implemented,
     hence the shambles which only got noticed if a var was declared
     after the floating point statics.
(B6) I have had another go at truncating overlong source file names, so
     tell me how close I am now!
(B7) Please try again.

(W1) -zs may now generate CODETABLE directives - I have not yet sorted out
     which refs should be DATASYMB and which CODESYMB.
(W2) ...
(W3) Not yet
(W4) -zl option recognized but not yet distinct from -zr.
(W5/W6) I want to get the other issues fixed before coping with this one,
     but I agree is has to be done.
(W7) I think I have disabled the code that inits things to zero
(W8) pcc mode not looked at yet
(W9) -S output not looked at yet (but maybe I need to do it to help me
     debug things...)
(W10) libraries - is this me?
(W11) not looked at yet
(W12) ditto
(W13) ditto

============

(W1) Well - I have had a go!
(W2) I think that most of the trouble here was spurious - when generating
     object code the compiler moaned if an offset was > 12 bits even though
     it was using two instructions to compute it and so it could cope with
     16 bits of offset.  Message should now be more realistic.

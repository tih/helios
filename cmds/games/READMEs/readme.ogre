Ogre is a game of tank warfare in the 21st century.  You command a force of
infantry, armor, and howitzers pitted against a giant cybernetic tank, the
Ogre.  Your mission is to destroy the Ogre, or at least render it immobile,
before it reaches and destroys your command post.

A more complete reference on how to play can be found in the Ogre rule book
for the Metagaming MicroGame, now distributed by Steve Jackson's company.

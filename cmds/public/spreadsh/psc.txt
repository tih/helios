NAME
     psc - prepare sc files

SYNOPSIS
     psc [ -_L_k_r ] [ -_s _c_e_l_l ] [ -_R _n ] [ -_C _n ] [ -_n _n ] [ -_d _c ]


DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_c is used to prepare data for input to  the  spread  sheet
     calculator  _s_c(_1).  It accepts normal ascii data on standard
     input.  Standard output is a _s_c file.  With no options,  _p_s_c
     starts  the spread sheet in cell A0.  Strings are right jus-
     tified.  All data on a line is entered on the same row;  new
     input lines cause the output row number to increment by one.
     The default delimiters are tab and space.  The  column  for-
     mats  are  set  to  one  larger  than  the number of columns
     required to hold the largest value in the column.

     Options:


     -L   Left justify strings.


     -k   Keep all delimiters.  This  option  causes  the  output
          cell to change on each new delimiter encountered in the
          input stream.   The default action is to condense  mul-
          tiple  delimters  to one, so that the cell only changes
          once per input data item.


     -r   Output the data by row first then  column.   For  input
          consisting  of a single column, this option will result
          in output of one row with multiple columns instead of a
          single column spread sheet.


     -s cell
          Start the top left corner of the spread sheet in  _c_e_l_l.
          For  example,  -_s  _B_3_3  will arrange the output data so
          that the spread sheet starts in column B, row 33.


     -R n Increment by _n on each new output row.


     -C n Increment by _n on each new output column.


     -n n Output _n rows before  advancing  to  the  next  column.
          This  option  is  used  when the input is arranged in a
          single column and the spread sheet is to have  multiple

     -d c Use the single character _c  as  the  delimiter  between
          input fields.

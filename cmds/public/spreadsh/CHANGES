	Support for TeX, LaTeX, and better support for tbl in "T" cmd.
	Provision of a copyent function to copy entries (same code repeated
		in several locations)
	Forwrow, backrow, forwcol, backcol functions to replace
		repeated code
	Correct interpretation of ESCAPE or ^G as an abort when in a 
		two character command such as 'ar' or 'ac'

       New help functions.
       Constant prescale "$"
       Added string matching to @lookup.
       Some more bug fixes.
       Testing, integration, documentation.

Alan Silverstein-
	Greatly revised the manual entry.
	Added menus for ^E command and row/column commands, which
	involved a bunch of code cleanup.

	Changed top row display to clearly indicate string labels
	versus number parts, and to distinguish string functions from
	constant labels.

	When the character cursor is on a cell (not topline), ^H
	(backspace) is like ^B (move back one cell), rather than being
	ignored.

	When the character cursor is on a cell (not topline), ^I (tab)
	is like ^F (move forward one cell), rather than being ignored.
	^R is no longer identical with ^L.  Now ^R highlights all cells
	which should be entered by a user because they contain constant
	numeric values (not the result of a numeric expression).

	Added a ^X command, similar to ^R, which highlights cells which
	have expressions.  It also displays the expressions in the
	highlighted cells as left-justified strings, instead of the
	label and/or value of the cell.

	Added indirection functions (@nval() and @sval()) for simple
	table lookups.  Given a column name and row number, they return
	the numeric or string value of the selected cell.

	Added external functions (@ext()) for non-trivial
	computations.  Given a command name and argument, it calls the
	command and reads back one output line.

	Added a ^T,e command to toggle enabling of external functions.

	Changed ^T,t to only control the top line display, and added
	^T,c to control current cell highlighting.  (Separated the
	functions.)

	"!" (shell escape) gives a vi-style warning if there were any
	changes since the last write.  (No change to manual entry.)

	Fixed some startup, error, and prompt messages to be cleaner
	and/or more consistent.  (No changes to manual entry.)

	Fixed a bug:  If @substr() upper bound (third parameter) is
	past the end of the string operand, return the substring
	through the end of the string, rather than returning a null
	string.

	Fixed a bug:  Reset SIGINT to default after forking before
	calling shell escape program and before starting pipeline (for
	commands which support this).  Didn't reset SIGINT before
	calling crypt and external functions because in both cases it
	should be irrelevant.  (No change to manual entry.)

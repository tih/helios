My well known but much maligned position on this is that you should
all fix your curses include file per Dr. Goldman's recommendations.
Consider it to be my bit to make the world cleaner.

     sc/vc compiled and ran fine on a VAX running 4.3 BSD at my site.  However,
it compiled, but screwed up the nl()/nonl() stuff, when run on my MicroVAX II
running Ultrix 1.2; the same problem occurred on a VAX running vanilla 4.2 BSD.
I traced it to a bug in the nl()/nonl() definitions in /usr/include/curses.h
that appears to exist only in the 4.2 BSD and Ultrix 1.X versions of that file.
I suspect that someone had fixed those definitions on the 4.2 BSD system you
tested it on.  (In fact, on a Sun 2 at my site running Sun UNIX 3.0 [basically
4.2 BSD with Sun enhancements], the nl()/nonl() stuff in /usr/include/curses.h
has been fixed [by Sun].  I haven't tried compiling sc/vc on it yet, however.) 

     The following patch to sc.c is necessary for vanilla 4.2 BSD machines and
Ultrix 1.2 (and presumably Ultrix 1.0 and 1.1) machines: 

*** sc.c	Tue Jan 27 15:54:31 1987
--- sc.c.new	Tue Jan 27 15:55:06 1987

Perhaps you should post it to comp.sources.d.  Thanks.

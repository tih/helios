This is a much modified version of the public domain spread sheet sc,
posted several years ago by Mark Weiser as vc, originally by James Gosling.

This release has been tested against a Sequent S81 running DYNIX 3.0.14
(BSD 4.2) and an ICM-3216 with system V.3.  The ICM has a National Semi
32016.  Just check the makefile for the system flags.   I have heard
reports of lots of other machines that work. If you have problems with
lex.c, and don't care about arrow keys, define SIMPLE (-DSIMPLE in the
makefile).  SIMPLE causes the arrow keys to not be used.

Sc is not a product of Sequent Computer Systems.  It is supplied as
is with no warranty, express or implied, as a service to Usenet readers.
It is not copyrighted, either.  Have at it.

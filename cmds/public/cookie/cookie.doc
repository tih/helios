     ideas  that  are  alien  to  them  are asked to not read the
     cookie file.  If you find quotes in the file that are  unat-
     tributed  and you know the attributions, please mail them to

     lowed by the name of its hash  file.   To  create  the  hash
     file,  use  /helios/lib/cookhash  which  reads  the  sayings
     from standard input and writes the hash values  to  standard
     output.   Sayings  within  the  input  file are separated by
     lines containing %% .

Here's the PD stuff as requested, and a few notes on it

MG is micro GNU emacs, and I haven't tried it

Compress you will need to read .Z files.

Perl is v 2.0, I haven't had time to strip the message headers off it. It
contains the first 10 patches as well. Perl is awk,sed and a bit of C rolled
into one.

Patch you will need, first do make realclean to remove the SUN  binaries.

Flex is a pd lex.

Less is more , do make clobber to clean up first.

At present (with James Davenport away) I don't know enough to be able to work
out what you need for TeX. Sorry

Good Luck
David Hutchinson

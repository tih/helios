This is the comp.sources.games distribution of Gnuchess.  The source
is the latest as of mid December 1987.  The C source is split into
two files in order to get the shar files into reasonable sizes for
network transfer.  I hacked up the man page based on the "help"
screen and a man page from an earlier release of gnuchess.  See the
file COPYING for the standard GNU info.

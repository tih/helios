The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  a new make macro BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS has been added to support systems
	that do not define platform-specific C preprocessor symbols.
     o  ftruncate on System V bugs have been fixed.
     o  the correct signal.h is now included.
     o  fork is now used instead of vfork.
     o  lines may now contain quoted colons (\:).

                          Release Notes for InterViews 2.5





                 The InterViews distribution is split into two main sub-
            directories,  one named _i_v, which contains InterViews source
            and associated files, and one named _g++, which contains  the
            GNU C++ compiler.  The InterViews libraries and applications
            do not require g++; you can use a different C++ compiler  if
            you wish.  The top-level Makefile will try to build g++.  If
            you do not want to use g++, then chdir to _i_v and  make  from
            there.

                 The file _i_v/_R_E_A_D_M_E describes how to  build  InterViews.
            Under  _i_v/_s_r_c,  the  directory  _I_n_t_e_r_V_i_e_w_s  contains include
            files, _b_i_n contains applications (each one in its  own  sub-
            directory), _l_i_b_I_n_t_e_r_V_i_e_w_s contains the base library classes,
            _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c contains the  structured  graphics  library,  and
            _l_i_b_t_e_x_t contains the structured text library.

                 The _s_t_e_d demo text editor  will  not  link  on  non-BSD
            platforms  because  the regular expression class (Regexp) is
            only implemented using the BSD library routines (_r_e__c_o_m_p and
            _r_e__e_x_e_c).   It  should  be straightforward to port it to use
            the System V library routines, but we did not have  time  to
            do so before the release.

                 Three publicly available applications are included with
            InterViews  because they are necessary for the configuration
            and operation of InterViews.  _I_m_a_k_e and _m_a_k_e_d_e_p_e_n_d come from
            the  X11R3 core distribution, with post-R3 improvements from
            Jim Fulton at MIT.  The _t_w_m window manager is from Tom  LaS-
            trange at Hewlett-Packard in Fort Collins, Colorado.

                 The directory _i_v/_m_a_n contains  troff  sources  for  the
            InterViews  release  notes  and manual pages.  The directory
            _i_v/_d_o_c contains LaTeX and PostScript for three papers and  a
            one-page  overview of InterViews.  The _c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n subdirec-
            tory contains the paper titled ``Composing  User  Interfaces
            with  InterViews''  that  was published in the February 1989
            issue of _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r.  The _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c subdirectory contains the
            paper titled ``Applying Object-Oriented Design to Structured
            Graphics'' that was published in  the  1988  C++  Conference
            proceedings.   The  _t_o_o_l_k_i_t  subdirectory contains the paper
            titled ``InterViews: A  C++  Graphical  Interface  Toolkit''
            that is a revised version of the paper published in the 1987
            C++ Conference proceedings.

                 The InterViews system supports the design and implemen-
            tation  of applications with graphical user interfaces.  The
            basic model of InterViews is _o_b_j_e_c_t-_o_r_i_e_n_t_e_d,  with  C++  as
            the  implementation  language.  This manual describes Inter-
            Views version 2.5, which runs as library code on top of  the
            X  window  system (the library can be compiled to run on ei-
            ther X10 or X11).  If you are not  running  X  already,  you
            should bring it up before trying to use the programs and li-
            brary routines documented here.   The  manual  also  assumes
            familiarity with C++.

                 The manual is organized into four  sections:  commands,
            the basic library (libInterViews), a structured graphics li-
            brary (libgraphic), and a structured text library (libtext).
            See  the  2.5  release  notes for more information about the
            distribution.

                 A number of people have contributed to the  design  and
            implementation  of  InterViews.   Paul  Calder  designed the
            boxes and glue model of combining interactive objects, wrote
            many  of  the  commands, and implemented the structured text
            library.  John Vlissides wrote the original version  of  the
            drawing  editor,  _i_d_r_a_w(1),  and the structured graphics li-
            brary.  Both Paul and John  have  also  contributed  to  the
            design  and implementation of the base library.  John Inter-
            rante wrote the current version of _i_d_r_a_w and added the ICCCM
            window  manager  protocol  support  to libInterViews.  Craig
            Dunwoody participated in the early design of InterViews.  We
            are  grateful  to  the growing InterViews user community for
            their encouragement and support.

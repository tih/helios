These documents are in LaTeX format.  First, run "uncompress *.ps.Z"
in the desired subdirectory to uncompress any PostScript files.  Then
you should be able to simply run "latex draft" to generate the DVI
file, followed by "dvi2ps" to generate PostScript.  Consult your local
TeX manual pages for details on how these commands work at your site.
Also in each subdirectory is a "draft.ps" file, which is a
ready-to-print PostScript version of the document.

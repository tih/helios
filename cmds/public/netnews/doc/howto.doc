          What is the Network News?

               USENET (Users' Network) is a  bulletin  board  shared  among
          many computer systems around the world.  USENET is a logical net-
          work, sitting on top  of  several  physical  networks,  including
          _U_U_C_P, _B_L_I_C_N, _B_E_R_K_N_E_T, _X._2_5, and the _A_R_P_A_N_E_T.  Sites on USENET in-
          clude many universities, private companies, and research  organi-
          zations.   Most  of  the  members of USENET are either university
          computer science departments or part of AT&T.   Currently,  there
          are  over  50,000  participants at over 2,000 USENET sites in the
          USA, Canada, Europe, Japan and Korea with more joining every day.
          Most are running the UNIX8*9 operating system.

               The network news, or simply _n_e_t_n_e_w_s, is the set of  programs
          that  provide access to the news and transfer it from one machine
          to the next.  Netnews was originally written at  Duke  University
          and has been modified extensively by the University of California
          at Berkeley and others.  Netnews allows articles to be posted for
          limited or very wide distribution.  This document contains a list
          of newsgroups that were active at the time the document was writ-
          ten.  It exists to assist you in determining which newsgroups you
          may want to subscribe to.  When creating a new article, the level
          of  distribution  can  be controlled by use of the "Distribution"
          field.  This will prevent notices of apartments for rent  in  New
          Jersey being broadcast to California (or even Europe).

               Any user can post an article, which will be sent out to  the
          network  to be read by persons interested in that topic.  You can
          specify which topics are of interest to you by putting them in  a
          _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t.  Then, whenever you ask to read news, the news
          reading program will present all  unread  articles  of  interest.
          There  are also facilities for browsing through old news, posting
          follow-up articles, and sending direct electronic mail replies to
          the author of an article.

9          How to Read the Network News                                    2


9               This paper is a tutorial, aimed at the  user  who  wants  to
          read  and  possibly post news.  The system administrator who must
          install the software should see  the  companion  document  _U_S_E_N_E_T
          _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _B _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n.

          Why USENET?

               USENET is useful in a number of ways.   Someone  wishing  to
          announce  a  new program or product can reach a wide audience.  A
          user can ask "Does anyone  have  an  _x?"  and  will  usually  get
          several  responses  within  a  day or two.  Bug reports and their
          fixes can be made quickly available without the usual overhead of
          sending  out mass mailings.  Discussions involving many people at
          different locations can take place without having to get everyone
          together.

               Another facility with similar capabilities to _n_e_t_n_e_w_s is the
          _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c _m_a_i_l_i_n_g _l_i_s_t.  A mailing list is a collection of elec-
          tronic mailing addresses of users who are interested in a partic-
          ular topic.  By sending electronic mail to the list, all users on
          the list receive a copy of the article.  While the  mailing  list
          facility  is  quite  useful, USENET offers a number of advantages
          not present in mailing lists.  Getting yourself on a mailing list
          is  not  always  easy.   You have to figure out who maintains the
          list and ask them to put you on it.  Often these people  are  out
          of  town or busy, and don't put you on the list for several days.
          Sometimes you have to send mail to the entire mailing list,  hop-
          ing that one of the readers will tell you who maintains the list.
          Once you are on the list, you often find yourself in  the  middle
          of  a  discussion.   Netnews keeps old articles around until they
          expire (usually about two weeks) so you can  browse  through  old
          news  to catch up on what you missed.  Similarly, referring to an
          old article is easy, without having to keep a  personal  file  of
          all old mail to the list.

               Another advantage is appreciated by the other users  of  the
          system.   There  is less overhead in having only one copy of each
          message sent to each machine, rather than having separate  copies
          sent  to  each  of  several users on the same machine.  This cuts
          down on computer time to process the messages, and on-line  costs
          for  telephone  calls  to  transfer  messages from one machine to
          another (when phone lines are used).  Another advantage is in the
          disk  space consumed.  When only one message is sent to each sys-
          tem, only one copy of the message is kept on disk.  In a  mailing
          list  environment, each user has a copy in a mailbox.  Of course,
          if the mailing list is small enough the overhead is less than  an
          international newsgroup.

          How do I Read News?

               In the USENET jargon, interest topics are called _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p_s.
          A  newsgroup list appears in a later section, current as this pa-
          per was written.  You have your own _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n  _l_i_s_t  of  news-
          groups to which you are said to _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e.


          News Version B 2.11                            Spetember 22, 1986





9          How to Read the Network News                                    3


9               The simplest way to read news is to type the command:

                                      readnews

          Other possibilities include: a full-screen-oriented news  reading
          program,  _v_n_e_w_s(1),  (described  in  the Appendix,) the _n_o_t_e_s_f_i_l_e
          system, which can also be used for news (described in a  separate
          paper,)  and  _r_n, a very popular news reading program distributed
          separately from this package.  Each newsgroup to which  you  sub-
          scribe will be presented, one article at a time.  As each article
          is presented, you will be shown the _h_e_a_d_e_r (containing  the  name
          of  the  author,  the subject, and the length of the article) and
          you will be asked if you want more.  There are a number of possi-
          ble  choices  you  can make at this point.  The three most common
          (y, n, and q) are suggested by the program.  (To see  a  complete
          list of possible responses, type ?  for help.) You can type y for
          "yes" (or simply hit <RETURN>) and the rest of the  message  will
          be  displayed.   (If  the  message is long, it may stop before it
          runs off the top of the screen.  Type <SPACE> or <RETURN> to  see
          more  of the message.  Another choice you can make is n for "no".
          This means you are not interested in the message - it will not be
          offered  to  you  again.   A  third option is q for "quit".  This
          causes a record to be made of which articles  you  read  (or  re-
          fused)  and  you  will  exit netnews.  When you have read all the
          news, this happens automatically.  The q command is mainly useful
          if  you  are  in a hurry and don't have time to read all the news
          right now.  (Many users put a _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s(1) or _c_h_e_c_k_n_e_w_s(1) command
          in  their ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e or ._l_o_g_i_n files so that they will see new news
          each time they log in.)

               If you are reading news for the first  time,  you  may  find
          yourself  swamped by the volume of unread news, especially if the
          default subscription is all.  Don't let this bother you.  If  you
          are  getting  newsgroups  in  which you have no interest, you can
          change your subscription list (see below).  Also,  bear  in  mind
          that what you see is probably at least two weeks' accumulation of
          news.  If you want to just get rid of  all  old  news  and  start
          anew, type

                                 readnews -K -n all

          which will throw away all old news, recording that you have  seen
          it  all.   Or,  you can use the K command to mark all articles in
          the current newsgroup as read.

               Once you catch up with (or ignore) all  the  old  news,  the
          news will come in daily at a more manageable rate.  (If the daily
          rate is still too much you may wish to unsubscribe to some of the
          higher  volume, less useful newsgroups.) Finally, note that while
          an article is printing, you  can  hit  your  interrupt  character
          (usually <CONTROL-C> or <DELETE>), which will throw away the rest
          of the article.

9               Among the other commands  you  can  type  after  seeing  the
          header of an article are:

          x            Exit _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s.  This is different from q in that the
                       q  command  will update the record of which articles
                       you have read, but x will pretend you never  started
                       _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s.

          N            Go on to the next newsgroup.  The remaining articles
                       in  the current newsgroup are considered _u_n_r_e_a_d, and
                       will be offered to you again the next time you  read
                       news.

          s _f_i_l_e       The article is saved in a disk file with  the  given
                       name.   In practice, what usually happens is that an
                       article is printed, and then  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s  goes  on  to
                       print  the header of the next article before you get
                       a chance to type anything.  So you usually  want  to
                       write  out  the  _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s  message (the last one you
                       have read in full); in this case, use  the  form  s-
                       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

          e            Erase the memory of having seen  this  article.   It
                       will  be  offered  to you again next time, as though
                       you had never seen  it.   The  variation  e-  (erase
                       memory of the previously read article instead of the
                       current article) is useful for  checking  follow-ups
                       to see if anyone has already said what you wanted to
                       say.

          r            Reply to the author of the  message.   You  will  be
                       placed  in the editor, with a set of headers derived
                       from the message you are replying to.  Type in  your
                       message  after  the blank line.  If you wish to edit
                       the header list to add more recipients or send  car-
                       bon  copies,  for  instance, you can edit the header
                       lines.  Anyone listed on a line beginning with  "To"
                       or  "Cc"  will  receive  a copy of your reply.  Note
                       that the path used to receive a piece  of  news  may
                       not be the fastest way to reply by mail. If speed is
                       important and you know a  faster  way,  edit  it  in
                       place  of  what  the reply command supplied.  A mail
                       command will then be started up,  addressed  to  the
                       persons listed in the header.  You are then returned
                       to _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s.  The case r- is also useful to reply to
                       the  previous message.  Another variation on this is
                       rd- which puts you in $MAILER  (or  _m_a_i_l(1)  by  de-
                       fault) to type in your reply directly.

          f            Post a follow-up  message  to  the  same  newsgroup.

          Changing your Subscription List

               If you take no special action you will subscribe  to  a  de-
          fault  subscription  list.  This default varies locally.  To find
          out your local default, type

                                     readnews -s

          Typically this list will include all newsgroups ending  in  "gen-
          eral"  or  "announce",  such  as general, and news.announce.  (As
          distributed, the default is general,all.announce.  Another  popu-
          lar  default  is  all.) You can change this by creating a file in
          your home directory named ._n_e_w_s_r_c which  contains  as  its  first
          line a line of the form:

                    options -n newsgroup,newsgroup,newsgroup ...

          If your lines get too long, you can continue them  on  subsequent
          lines by beginning those lines with a space.  (The netnews system
          will put extra lines in this file to record  which  articles  you
          have read.  You should ignore these lines unless you want to edit
          them.) For example, if you are creating a subscription  list  for
          the  first  time,  and have already read news, you will find some
          text already in your ._n_e_w_s_r_c file, recording which  articles  you
          have  read.   You  should  put your options line before the first
          line of the file.) Thus,

          all  can be used as a wild card, representing any newsgroup.  You
          can also use all as a prefix or suffix to match a class of  news-
          groups.  For example,

                      options -n all,!talk,!rec.humor,!all.unix

          will result in a subscription to all newsgroups except for "talk"
          group,  jokes, and any UNIX information.  The metacharacter .  is
          like / to the shell, and all is like *.

               A simpler way to subscribe to news is to subscribe  to  all,
          and  then use the U _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s command to unsubscribe to newsgroups
          you don't want to read.  This way you  will  see  new  newsgroups
          that  are created, get a chance to evaluate them, and then unsub-
          scribe to those that don't interest you.

               The order of the newsgroups in your ._n_e_w_s_r_c (after  the  op-
          tions  line)  is the order in which newsgroups will be shown.  If
          you want something other than the default, move the lines  around
          until  you  are satisfied with the order.  Be careful to keep the
          options line as the first line in the file.

          Submitting Articles

               To submit a new news article type

                                      postnews

          First, it will ask you if this is  a  follow-up  to  an  article.
          Answer  yes or no.  If yes, you really should have done an f from
          _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s, but it will try and figure out which  article  you  are
          following up to.  It will ask for the newsgroup in which you read
          the article and the article number.  If you  can't  remember,  go
          back  to _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s and find out.  It is important that discussions
          are kept together.  It is very frustrating for someone to read  a
          follow-up that says: "I agree.  It's very dangerous to leave that
          program as distributed." and not have any idea  what  the  poster
          was referring to.

               If you answer no, _p_o_s_t_n_e_w_s(1) will ask you for  the  subject
          of  the  new article.  This should be as informative as possible.
          For example, "'67 Porsche for sale in New Jersey" is much  better
          than  "Car  for sale" or even "For sale".  It will then ask which
          newsgroups you want the article posted in.  If  you  are  unsure,
          type  ?  instead of a specific newsgroup and it will show you the
          list of currently available groups.  Then, you will be asked  how
          far  your article should be distributed.  It is important to keep
          this as small as possible to accomplish the purpose of your arti-
          cle.    Remember   that  many  newsgroups  are  read  in  Europe,

          It  does no good (to use the previous example) to post a "Car for
          sale in New Jersey" article with a distribution of world.   There
          is almost no chance that a person in Sweden or Korea would be in-
          terested in buying your car (even if it is a Porsche).  It  is  a
          waste  of  money  and  computer resources to transmit the article
          that far.  For this specific case, the  appropriate  distribution
          would  be  nj or only in New Jersey.  If there were no local dis-
          tribution available, at least it should be confined to  usa.   If
          you  are unsure of the distributions available at your site, type
          ?  instead of a distribution and you will receive a list of  dis-
          tributions  valid  for  your site.  If the distribution is world,
          your article will be read (perhaps with disgust) by thousands  of
          people around the world.

               Then you will be placed in the editor.  Enter  the  text  of
          your article, after the blank line, and exit the editor.  The ar-
          ticle will be posted to the newsgroups specified.  If you  change
          your  mind  about  the headers while you are still in the editor,
          you can edit them as well.  Extra headers can also be  added  be-
          fore the blank line.

          Browsing through Old News

               There are a number of command line options to  the  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s
          command  to  help  you find an old article you want to see again.
          The -n _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p_s option restricts your search to  certain  news-
          groups.   The -x option arranges to ignore the record of articles
          read, which is kept in your ._n_e_w_s_r_c file.  This  will  cause  all
          articles   in  all  newsgroups  to  which  you  subscribe  to  be
          displayed, even those which  you  have  already  seen.   It  also
          causes  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s to not update the ._n_e_w_s_r_c file.  The -a _d_a_t_e op-
          tion asks for news received after the given _d_a_t_e.  Note that even
          with  the -a option, only articles you have not already seen will
          be printed, unless you combine it with the -x option.   (Articles
          are  kept  on file until they expire, typically after two weeks.)
          The -t _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s option restricts the query to articles mentioning
          one  of the _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s in the title of the article.  Thus, the com-
          mand

                 readnews -n comp.unix -x -a last thursday -t setuid

          asks for all articles in newsgroup comp.unix since last  Thursday
          about  the  setuid feature.  (Be careful with the -t option.  The
          above example will not find articles about "suid",  nor  will  it
          find  articles with no title or whose author did not use the word
          "setuid" in the title.)

               Other useful options include the -l option (which lists only
          the headers of articles - a useful form for browsing through lots
          of messages.) The -p option prints the  messages  without  asking
          for  any  input;  this  is similar to some older news programs on
          many UNIX systems  and  is  useful  for  directing  output  to  a
          printer.   The -r option produces articles in reverse order, from

          User Interfaces

               The _u_s_e_r _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e of a program is the view it  presents  to
          the user, that is, what it prints and what it allows you to type.
          _R_e_a_d_n_e_w_s has options allowing you to use  different  user  inter-
          faces.  The interface described above is called the "msgs" inter-
          face because it mimics the style of the Berkeley _m_s_g_s(1) program.
          (This  program,  in  turn,  mimics  a  program at MIT of the same
          name.) The key element of the msgs interface is that after print-
          ing  the  header,  you are asked if you want the rest of the mes-
          sage.

               Another interface is available with the -c option.  In  this
          case, the entire message is printed, header and body, and you are
          prompted at the end of the message.  The command options are  the
          same  as  the  msgs interface, but it is usually not necessary to
          use the - suffix on the r, s, or f commands.  This  interface  is
          called the "/bin/mail" (pronounced "bin mail") interface, because
          it mimics the UNIX program of that name.

               A third interface is the _M_a_i_l(1) (pronounced "cap mail") in-
          terface,  available  with  the  -M option.  This invokes the _M_a_i_l
          program directly, and allows you to read news with the same  com-
          mands  as  you  read  mail.  (This interface may not work on your
          system - it requires a special version of _M_a_i_l with a -T option.)

               A fourth interface, is the MH news/mail program  from  Rand.
          That program can be used directly to read network news.

               A fifth interface, _v_n_e_w_s, which works well on display termi-
          nals, is described in the Appendix.

               A sixth possibility is the _n_o_t_e_s_f_i_l_e system, described in  a
          separate paper.  It is also display-oriented.

               A seventh interface is _r_n.  It is quite powerful and  remin-
          iscent of the EMACS text editor.

               An eighth possibility is to use your favorite mail system as
          an  interface.  There are a number of different mail reading pro-
          grams, including /_b_i_n/_m_a_i_l(1), _M_a_i_l, _m_s_g(1), and  MH.   Any  mail
          system  with  an  option to specify an alternative mailbox can be
          used to read news.  For example, to use _M_a_i_l without the  -M  op-
          tion, type

                               readnews -c "Mail -f %"

          The shell command in quotes is invoked as a  child  of  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s.
          The  -f  option  to _M_a_i_l names the alternative mailbox.  _R_e_a_d_n_e_w_s
          will put the news in a temporary file, and give the name of  this
          file  to  the  mailer  in  place of the %.  There is an important
          difference when using this kind of interface.  The mailers do not

9          give any indication of which articles you read and which ones you
          skipped.  _R_e_a_d_n_e_w_s will assume you read _a_l_l the articles, even if
          you  didn't,  and mark them all read.  By contrast, the -M option
          uses the -T option to _M_a_i_l, asking _M_a_i_l to  tell  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s  which
          articles you read.

          Getting News when you Log In

               Most users like to be told when they first log in  if  there
          is any news.  This way they are reminded of news, but are not in-
          terrupted by it during the day.  If you log in once in the  morn-
          ing,  you  can  think  of getting the news as reading the morning
          newspaper.  It is common to put a _c_h_e_c_k_n_e_w_s or  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s  command
          in  your  ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e  or  ._l_o_g_i_n file of commands that are executed
          when you log in.

               Since there might not be any news, and  since  the  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s
          command  goes to a considerable amount of work to find all unread
          news (assuming you are going to read it), there is  another  com-
          mand,  called  _c_h_e_c_k_n_e_w_s,  which  tells you if there is any news.
          The _c_h_e_c_k_n_e_w_s command is smaller and faster  than  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s,  and
          was designed especially for a login file.  There are also options
          to be silent if there is (or is not) news, and to start up  _r_e_a_d_-
          _n_e_w_s automatically if there is news.

               The options to _c_h_e_c_k_n_e_w_s are:

          -y        Print "There is news" if there is any unread news.

          -v        If -y is also given,  instead  of  printing  "There  is
                    news",  prints "News: _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p ..." giving the name of
                    the first newsgroup containing unread news.  If general
                    is  the  first newsgroup presented, this can be used to
                    tell users whether the unread news is important.

          -n        Print "No news" if there is no unread news.

          -e        If there is any unread news, start  up  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s.   Any
                    additional  arguments  after  the  -e will be passed to
                    readnews.

               Thus,

                                    checknews -yn

          tells you whether there is any unread news.

                                   checknews -e -M

          starts up _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s with the _M_a_i_l interface if there is news,  and
          otherwise does nothing.

                                    checknews -y

          Creating New Newsgroups

               New newsgroups are proposed by the users and created by site
          administrators.   To  create a newsgroup, first make sure this is
          the right thing to do.  Normally a suggestion is first posted  to
          news.groups,whatever.relatedgroup  for  a  world  wide  newsgroup
          (whatever.relatedgroup should be the group which you are  propos-
          ing   to   subdivide.)   For   example,   to   propose   creating
          rec.arts.tv.soaps,    post    the     original     article     to
          rec.arts.tv,news.groups).   Followups  are  made  to  news.groups
          _o_n_l_y.  (You can force this by putting the line:

                              Followup-To: news.groups

          in the headers of your original posting).  If it  is  established
          that  there  is  general  interest in such a group, and a name is
          agreed on, then ask your local netnews  administrator  to  create
          the  newsgroup.   (It  can actually be created by any netnews ad-
          ministrator anywhere on the net, within the scope  of  the  news-
          group.)  Once  the newsgroup is created and the first article has
          been posted, the newsgroup is available for all  interested  per-
          sons to post to.

          List of Newsgroups

               This section lists the newsgroups that are currently active.
          It  is intended to help you decide what you want to subscribe to.
          Note that the list is constantly changing.  Note also  that  this
          list  only  describes  those  groups  available on a network-wide
          basis. Since not all installations choose to  receive  all  news-
          groups, it is recommended that each installation edit the list of
          local newsgroups to be correct before distributing this  document
          to their users.  If this is not possible, a local appendix can be
          created.

          Local

               Local groups are kept on the current  machine  only.   Local
          names  can  be identified by the lack of a prefix, that is, there
          are no periods in local newsgroup names.

          general   News to be read by everyone on the local machine.   For
                    example:  "The  system  will be down Monday morning for
                    PM." Or, "A new version  of  program  _x  has  been  in-
                    stalled." This newsgroup is usually mandatory - you are
                    required to subscribe to this newsgroup.  (The list  of
                    mandatory  newsgroups varies locally.) This requirement
                    assures that important announcements reach  all  users.

               _V_n_e_w_s is a program for reading USENET news.  It is based  on
          _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s  but  has  a  CRT-oriented (full screen) user interface.
          The command line options are identical.  The  list  of  available
          commands  is  quite similar, although since _v_n_e_w_s is a _v_i_s_u_a_l in-
          terface, most _v_n_e_w_s commands do not have to be  terminated  by  a
          newline.

               _V_n_e_w_s uses all but the last  two  lines  of  the  screen  to
          display  the  current  article.  The next to the last line is the
          secondary prompt line, and is used to input string  arguments  to
          commands.   The  last  line  contains  several fields.  The first
          field is the prompt field.  If _v_n_e_w_s is at the end of an article,
          the  prompt  is  "next?";  otherwise  the prompt is "more?".  The
          second field is the newsgroup field, which displays  the  current
          newsgroup,  the  number of the current article, and the number of
          the last article in the newsgroup.  The third field contains  the
          current  time, and the last field contains the word "mail" if you
          have mail.  When you receive new mail, the bell on  the  terminal
          is  rung  and  the  word "MAIL" appears in capital letters for 30
          seconds.

          Commands

               Most of the _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s commands have  _v_n_e_w_s  counterparts  and
          vice versa.  Some differences are:

               o+    It lacks a "digest" command  (to  deal  specially  with
                    collections  of articles bundled together).  This would
                    be nice to have, but it does not seem to be a major de-
                    ficiency  since  you can move around in the digest with
                    _v_n_e_w_s commands.

               o+    To get to the previous group, use the N command with  a
                    - argument.

               o+    _V_n_e_w_s has commands for moving  around  in  the  article
                    which _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s does not have since they aren't applica-
                    ble.

               o+    It has a "parent" command which will go to the  article
                    that  the  current  article  is  a  follow-up to, and a
                    "write" command that writes out the body of an  article
                    without the header.

               o+    You can refer to the current article from the shell  or
                    while writing a follow-up as $A.

               o+    The "decrypt" command (for decoding possibly  offensive
                    material)  always  does _r_o_t_1_3 which seems to be the de-
                    fault  standard  but  the  _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s   version   of   it

               Each _v_n_e_w_s command may be preceded by a  _c_o_u_n_t.   Some  com-
          mands  use  the count; others ignore it.  If _c_o_u_n_t is omitted, it
          defaults to one.  Some commands prompt for  an  argument  on  the
          second  line  from the bottom of the screen.  Standard UNIX erase
          and kill processing is done on this argument.   The  argument  is
          terminated  by a return.  An interrupt (<DELETE> or <BREAK>) gets
          you out of any partially entered command.

          <CR> A carriage return prints more of  the  current  article,  or
               goes  on  to  the  next article if you are at the end of the
               current article.  A <SPACE> is equivalent to <CR>.

          <CONTROL-B>
               Go backwards _c_o_u_n_t pages.

          <CONTROL-F>
               Go forward _c_o_u_n_t pages.

          <CONTROL-D>
               Go forwards half a page.

          <CONTROL-U>
               Go backwards half a page.

          <CONTROL-N>
               Go forwards _c_o_u_n_t lines.

          <CONTROL-Z>
               Go backwards _c_o_u_n_t lines.

          <CONTROL-L>
               Redraw the screen.  <CONTROL-L> may be typed at any time.

          b    Back up one article in the current group.

          l    Redisplay the article after you have sent a follow-up or re-
               ply.

          n    Move on to the next item in a digest.  .  is  equivalent  to
               n.  This is convenient if your terminal has a keypad.

          p    Show the parent article (the article that the current  arti-
               cle  is  a  follow-up to).  This doesn't work if the current
               article was posted  by  A-news  or  notesfiles.   To  switch
               between  the current and parent articles, use the - command.
               Unfortunately, if you use several p commands  to  trace  the
               discussion  back  further,  there is no command to return to
               the original level.

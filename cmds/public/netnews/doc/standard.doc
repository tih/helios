          1.  Introduction

               This document defines the standard  format  for  the  inter-
          change of network News articles among USENET sites.  It describes
          the format for articles themselves, and gives  partial  standards
          for  transmission of news.  The news transmission is not entirely
          standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility  to  the
          individual  hosts  to  choose transmission hardware and software,
          whether to batch news, and so on.

               There are five sections to this document.  Section two  sec-
          tion defines the format.  Section three defines the valid control
          messages.   Section  four  specifies  some   valid   transmission
          methods.  Section five describes the overall news propagation al-
          gorithm.

          2.  Article Format

               The primary consideration in choosing an article  format  is
          that it fit in with existing tools as well as possible.  Existing
          tools include both implementations of mail and news.  (The _n_o_t_e_s_-
          _f_i_l_e_s system from the University of Illinois is considered a news
          implementation.) A standard format for mail messages has  existed
          for  many years on the ARPANET, and this format meets most of the
          needs of USENET.  Since the ARPANET format is extensible,  exten-
          sions  to  meet  the  additional  needs of USENET are easily made
          within the ARPANET standard.  Therefore, the rule is adopted that
          all  USENET news articles must be formatted as valid ARPANET mail
          messages, according to the ARPANET standard RFC 822.  This  stan-
          dard is more restrictive than the ARPANET standard, placing addi-
          tional requirements on each article and forbidding use of certain
          ARPANET features.  However, it should always be possible to use a
          tool expecting an ARPANET message to process a news article.   In
          any  situation  where  this  standard  conflicts with the ARPANET
          standard, RFC 822 should be considered correct and this  standard
          in error.

               The body of the article comes here, with no blank line.

               An article consists of several header lines, followed  by  a
          blank  line,  followed  by  the  body of the message.  The header
          lines consist of a keyword, a colon, a blank, and some additional
          information.   This  is a subset of the ARPANET standard, simpli-
          fied to allow simpler software to handle it.  The "From" line may
          optionally  include  a full name, in the format above, or use the
          ARPANET angle bracket syntax.  To keep the  implementations  sim-
          ple, other formats (for example, with part of the machine address
          after the close parenthesis) are not allowed.  The  ARPANET  con-
          vention  of  continuation header lines (beginning with a blank or
          tab) is allowed.

               Certain headers are required, and certain other headers  are
          optional.   Any  unrecognized  headers  are  allowed, and will be
          passed through  unchanged.   The  required  headers  are  "From",

9          "Date",  "Newsgroups",  "Subject", "Message-ID", and "Path".  The
          optional  headers  are  "Followup-To",   "Expires",   "Reply-To",
          "Sender",  "References",  "Control",  "Distribution", "Keywords",
          "Summary", "Approved", "Lines", "Xref", "Nf-ID",  "Nf-From",  and
          "Organization".

          2.1.  Required Headers

          2.1.1.  From

               The "From" line contains the electronic mailing  address  of
          the person who sent the message, in the ARPA internet syntax.  It
          may optionally also contain the  full  name  of  the  person,  in
          parentheses,  after  the  electronic address.  The electronic ad-
          dress is the same as the entity responsible for  originating  the
          article, unless the "Sender" header is present, in which case the
          "From" header might not be verified.  Note that in all  site  and
          domain  names, upper and lower case are considered the same, thus
          "mark@cbosgd.UUCP",  "mark@cbosgd.uucp",  and  "mark@CBosgD.UUcp"
          are all equivalent.  User names may or may not be case sensitive,
          for  example,  "Billy@cbosgd.UUCP"  might   be   different   from
          "BillY@cbosgd.UUCP".   Programs should avoid changing the case of
          electronic addresses when forwarding news or mail.

               RFC 822 specifies that all text in parentheses is to be  in-
          terpreted  as  a  comment.  It is common in ARPANET mail to place
          the full name of the user in a comment at the end of  the  "From"
          line.   This  standard  specifies  a more rigid syntax.  The full
          name is not considered a comment, but an  optional  part  of  the
          header  line.   Either the full name is omitted, or it appears in
          parentheses after the electronic address of  the  person  posting
          the  article, or it appears before an electronic address enclosed
          in angle brackets.  Thus, the three permissible forms are:

               From: mark@cbosgd.UUCP
               From: mark@cbosgd.UUCP (Mark Horton)
               From: Mark Horton <mark@cbosgd.UUCP>

          Full names may contain any printing ASCII characters  from  space
          through  tilde,  except  that  they  may  not  contain  "(" (left
          parenthesis), ")" (right parenthesis), "<" (left angle  bracket),
          or  ">"  (right  angle  bracket).  Additional restrictions may be
          placed on full names by the mail  standard,  in  particular,  the
          characters  ","  (comma),  ":"  (colon),  and ";" (semicolon) are
          inadvisable in full names.

          2.1.2.  Date

               The "Date" line (formerly "Posted") is the date, in a format
          that must be acceptable both to the ARPANET and to the _g_e_t_d_a_t_e(3)
          routine, that the article was originally posted to  the  network.
          This   date  remains  unchanged  as  the  article  is  propagated
          throughout the network.  One format that is acceptable to both is

9                          _W_d_y, _D_D _M_o_n _Y_Y _H_H:_M_M:_S_S _T_I_M_E_Z_O_N_E

          Several examples of valid dates  appear  in  the  sample  article
          above.  Note in particular that _c_t_i_m_e(3) format:

                              _W_d_y _M_o_n _D_D _H_H:_M_M:_S_S _Y_Y_Y_Y

          is _n_o_t acceptable because it is not a valid ARPANET date.  Howev-
          er, since older software still generates this format, news imple-
          mentations are encouraged to accept this format and translate  it
          into an acceptable format.

               The contents of the _T_I_M_E_Z_O_N_E field is currently  subject  to
          revision.   Eventually,  we hope to accept all possible worldwide
          time zone abbreviations, including the usual American zones (PST,
          PDT,  MST,  MDT,  CST,  CDT,  EST, EDT), the other North American
          zones (Bering through Newfoundland), European  zones,  Australian
          zones, and so on.  Lacking a complete list at present (and unsure
          if an unambiguous list  exists),  authors  of  software  are  en-
          couraged to keep this code flexible, and in particular not to as-
          sume that time zone names are exactly three letters long.  Imple-
          mentations  are  free  to  edit  this field, keeping the time the
          same, but changing the time zone (with an appropriate  adjustment
          to the local time shown) to a known time zone.  It is recommended
          that times in message headers be transmitted in GMT and displayed
          in the local time zone.

          2.1.3.  Newsgroups

               The "Newsgroups" line specifies  which  newsgroup  or  news-
          groups the article belongs in.  Multiple newsgroups may be speci-
          fied, separated by a comma.  Newsgroups specified must all be the
          names of existing newsgroups, as no new newsgroups will be creat-
          ed by simply posting to them.

               Wildcards (_e._g., the word all) are never allowed in a "News-
          groups"  line.   For  example,  a  newsgroup comp.all is illegal,
          although a newsgroup name rec.sport.football is permitted.

               If an article is received with a "Newsgroups"  line  listing
          some  valid newsgroups and some invalid newsgroups, a site should
          not remove invalid newsgroups from the list.   Instead,  the  in-
          valid  newsgroups should be ignored.  For example, suppose site _A
          subscribes to the classes btl.all  and  comp.all,  and  exchanges
          news  articles  with site _B, which subscribes to comp.all but not
          btl.all.  Suppose _A receives an article with

                          Newsgroups: comp.unix,btl.general

          This article is passed on to _B because _B receives comp.unix,  but
          _B  does  not  receive btl.general.  _A must leave the "Newsgroups"
          line unchanged.  If it were to  remove  btl.general,  the  edited
          header  could  eventually reenter the btl.all class, resulting in
          an article that is not shown to users subscribing to btl.general.

9          Also,  followups  from outside btl.all would not be shown to such
          users.

          2.1.4.  Subject

               The "Subject" line (formerly "Title") tells what the article
          is  about.  It should be suggestive enough of the contents of the
          article to enable a reader to make a decision whether to read the
          article  based on the subject alone.  If the article is submitted
          in response to another article (_e._g., is a _f_o_l_l_o_w_u_p) the  default
          subject  should  begin  with  the  four characters "Re: " and the
          "Reference" line is required.  (The user might wish to  edit  the
          subject  of  the followup, but the default should begin with "Re:
          ".)

          2.1.5.  Message-ID

               The "Message-ID" line gives the article a unique identifier.
          The  same Message-ID may not be reused during the lifetime of any
          article with the same Message-ID.  (It  is  recommended  that  no
          Message-ID  be  reused for at least two years.) Message-ID's have
          the syntax

                        <_s_t_r_i_n_g _n_o_t _c_o_n_t_a_i_n_i_n_g _b_l_a_n_k _o_r ">">

          In order to conform to RFC 822, the Message-ID must have the for-
          mat

                              <_u_n_i_q_u_e@_f_u_l_l__d_o_m_a_i_n__n_a_m_e>

          where _f_u_l_l__d_o_m_a_i_n__n_a_m_e is the full name of the host at which  the
          article  entered the network, including a domain that host is in,
          and _u_n_i_q_u_e is any string of printing ASCII  characters,  not  in-
          cluding  "<"  (left angle bracket), ">" (right angle bracket), or
          "@" (at sign).  For example, the _u_n_i_q_u_e part could be an  integer
          representing a sequence number for articles submitted to the net-
          work, or a short string derived from the date and time the  arti-
          cle  was created.  For example, a valid Message-ID for an article
          submitted from site _u_c_b_v_a_x  in  domain  "Berkeley.EDU"  would  be
          "<4123@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU>".   Programmers are urged not to make
          assumptions about the content of  Message-ID  fields  from  other
          hosts, but to treat them as unknown character strings.  It is not
          safe, for example, to assume that a Message-ID will be  under  14
          characters,  that  it  is  unique in the first 14 characters, nor
          that is does not contain a "/".

               The angle brackets are considered part  of  the  Message-ID.
          Thus,  in  references to the Message-ID, such as the _i_h_a_v_e/_s_e_n_d_m_e
          and cancel control messages, the  angle  brackets  are  included.
          White space characters (_e._g., blank and tab) are not allowed in a
          Message-ID.  Slashes ("/") are strongly discouraged.  All charac-
          ters  between  the  angle brackets must be printing ASCII charac-
          ters.

9          2.1.6.  Path

               This line shows the path  the  article  took  to  reach  the
          current  system.   When  a system forwards the message, it should
          add its own name to the list of systems in the "Path" line.   The
          names may be separated by any punctuation character or characters
          (except "." which is considered  part  of  the  hostname).   Thus
          "cbosgd!mhuxj!mhuxt",        "cbosgd,        mhuxj,       mhuxt",
          "@cbosgd.uucp,@mhuxj.uucp,@mhuxt.uucp"   and    even    "teklabs,
          zehntel,  sri-unix@cca!decvax"  are  valid  entries.  (The latter
          path indicates a message that passed through  _d_e_c_v_a_x,  _c_c_a,  _s_r_i-
          _u_n_i_x,  _z_e_h_n_t_e_l,  and  _t_e_k_l_a_b_s,  in  that order.) Additional names
          should be added from the left, for example, the most recently ad-
          ded  name  in  the  third  example was _t_e_k_l_a_b_s.  Letters, digits,
          periods and hyphens are considered  part  of  site  names;  other
          punctuation, including blanks, are considered separators.

               Normally, the rightmost name will be the name  of  the  ori-
          ginating  system.   However, it is also permissible to include an
          extra entry on the right, which is the name of the sender.   This
          is for upward compatibility with older system.

               The "Path" line is not used for replies, and should  not  be
          taken as a mailing address.  It is intended to show the route the
          message traveled to reach the local site.  There are several uses
          for  this information.  One is to monitor USENET routing for per-
          formance reasons.  Another is to establish a path  to  reach  new
          sites.   Perhaps  the  most important is to cut down on redundant
          USENET traffic by failing to forward a message to a site that  is
          known  to  have  already received it.  In particular, when site _A
          sends an article to site _B, the "Path" line includes _A,  so  that
          site _B will not immediately send the article back to site _A.  The
          site name each site uses to identify itself should be the same as
          the  name  by  which its neighbors know it, in order to make this
          optimization possible.

               A site adds its own name to the front of a path when it  re-
          ceives a message from another site.  Thus, if a message with path
          "A!X!Y!Z" is passed from site _A to site _B, _B  will  add  its  own
          name  to  the  path  when  it  receives the message from _A, _e._g.,
          "B!A!X!Y!Z".  If _B then passes the message on to _C,  the  message
          sent  to _C will contain the path "B!A!X!Y!Z", and when _C receives
          it, _C will change it to "C!B!A!X!Y!Z".

               Special  upward  compatibility  note:  Since   the   "From",
          "Sender",  and "Reply-To" lines are in internet format, and since
          many USENET sites do not yet have mailers capable of  understand-
          ing  internet format, it would break the reply capability to com-
          pletely sever the connection between the "Path"  header  and  the
          reply  function.   It is recognized that the path is not always a
          valid reply string in older implementations, and  no  requirement
          to  fix  this problem is placed on implementations.  However, the
          existing convention of placing the site name and an  "!"  at  the
          front  of  the path, and of starting the path with the site name,

9          an "!", and the user name, should be maintained when possible.

          2.2.  Optional Headers

          2.2.1.  Reply-To

               This line has the same format as "From".  If present, mailed
          replies  to  the  author  should  be sent to the name given here.
          Otherwise, replies are mailed to the name  on  the  "From"  line.
          (This does not prevent additional copies from being sent to reci-
          pients named by the replier, or on "To" or "Cc" lines.) The  full
          name  may  be  optionally given, in parentheses, as in the "From"
          line.

          2.2.2.  Sender

               This field is present only if the submitter manually  enters
          a  "From"  line.  It is intended to record the entity responsible
          for submitting the article to the network, and should be verified
          by the software at the submitting site.

               For example, if John Smith is visiting  CCA  and  wishes  to
          post an article to the network, using friend Sarah Jones account,
          the message might read

               From: smith@ucbvax.uucp (John Smith)
               Sender: jones@cca.arpa (Sarah Jones)

          If a gateway program enters a mail message into  the  network  at
          site _s_r_i-_u_n_i_x, the lines might read

               From: John.Doe@A.CS.CMU.EDU
               Sender: network@sri-unix.ARPA

          The primary purpose of this field is to be able to track down ar-
          ticles  to determine how they were entered into the network.  The
          full name may be optionally given,  in  parentheses,  as  in  the
          "From" line.

          2.2.3.  Followup-To

               This line has the same format as "Newsgroups".  If  present,
          follow-up  articles  are  to  be posted to the newsgroup or news-
          groups listed here.  If this line is not present,  followups  are
          posted  to the newsgroup or newsgroups listed in the "Newsgroups"
          line.

               If the keyword _p_o_s_t_e_r is present, followup articles are  not
          permitted.  The  message should be mailed to the submitter of the
          article via mail.

9          2.2.4.  Expires

               This line, if present, is in a legal USENET date format.  It
          specifies  a  suggested  expiration date for the article.  If not
          present, the local default expiration date is used.   This  field
          is  intended  to be used to clean up articles with a limited use-
          fulness, or to keep important articles  around  for  longer  than
          usual.   For  example,  a  message announcing an upcoming seminar
          could have an expiration date the day after  the  seminar,  since
          the message is not useful after the seminar is over.  Since local
          sites have local policies for expiration of  news  (depending  on
          available  disk  space, for instance), users are discouraged from
          providing expiration dates for articles unless there is a natural
          expiration  date  associated  with  the  topic.   System software
          should almost never provide a default "Expires" line.   Leave  it
          out  and  allow  local policies to be used unless there is a good
          reason not to.

          2.2.5.  References

               This field lists the Message-ID's of any articles  prompting
          the submission of this article.  It is required for all follow-up
          articles, and forbidden when a new subject is raised.   Implemen-
          tations  should  provide a follow-up command, which allows a user
          to post a follow-up article.   This  command  should  generate  a
          "Subject"  line which is the same as the original article, except
          that if the original subject does not begin with "Re: "  or  "re:
          ",  the  four  characters "Re: " are inserted before the subject.
          If there is no "References" line  on  the  original  header,  the
          "References"  line  should contain the Message-ID of the original
          article (including the angle brackets).  If the original  article
          does have a "References" line, the followup article should have a
          "References" line containing the text  of  the  original  "Refer-
          ences" line, a blank, and the Message-ID of the original article.

               The purpose of the "References" header is to allow  articles
          to  be  grouped into conversations by the user interface program.
          This allows conversations within a newsgroup to be kept together,
          and potentially users might shut off entire conversations without
          unsubscribing to a newsgroup.  User interfaces need not make  use
          of  this header, but all automatically generated followups should
          generate the "References" line for the benefit of systems that do
          use  it,  and  manually  generated followups (_e._g., typed in well
          after the original article  has  been  printed  by  the  machine)
          should be encouraged to include them as well.

               It is permissible to not include the entire previous "Refer-
          ences"  line  if it is too long. An attempt should be made to in-
          clude a reasonable number of backwards references.

          2.2.6.  Control

               If an article contains a "Control" line, the  article  is  a
          control  message.   Control  messages  are used for communication


          News Version B 2.11                            September 19, 1986





9          Standard for Interchange of USENET MessagesDRAFT                             9


9          among USENET host machines, not to be  read  by  users.   Control
          messages are distributed by the same newsgroup mechanism as ordi-
          nary messages.  The body of the "Control" header line is the mes-
          sage to the host.

               For upward compatibility, messages that match the  newsgroup
          pattern  all.all.ctl  should  also be interpreted as control mes-
          sages.  If no "Control" header is present on such  messages,  the
          subject  is  used  as  the control message.  However, messages on
          newsgroups matching this pattern do not conform to this standard.

               Also for upward compatibility, if the first 5 characters  of
          the  "Subject:"  line are "cmsg", the rest of the "Subject:" line
          should be interpreted as a control message.

          2.2.7.  Distribution

               This line is used to alter the  distribution  scope  of  the
          message.   It has the same format as the "Newsgroups" line.  User
          subscriptions are still controlled by "Newsgroups", but the  mes-
          sage  is sent to all systems subscribing to the newsgroups on the
          "Distribution" line instead of the "Newsgroups"  line.   Thus,  a
          car for sale in New Jersey might have headers including

               Newsgroups: rec.auto,misc.forsale
               Distribution: nj

          so that it would only go to persons subscribing  to  rec.auto  or
          misc.forsale  within New Jersey.  The intent of this header is to
          restrict the distribution of a newsgroup further, not to increase
          it.  A local newsgroup, such as nj.crazy-eddie, will probably not
          be propagated by sites outside New Jersey that do not show such a
          newsgroup as valid.  Followup articles should default to the same
          "Distribution" line as the original article,  but  the  user  can
          change  it to a more limited one, or escalate the distribution if
          it was originally restricted and a more widely distributed  reply
          is appropriate.

          2.2.8.  Organization

               The text of this line is a short phrase describing  the  or-
          ganization  to  which the sender belongs, or to which the machine
          belongs.  The intent of this line is to help identify the  person
          posting the message, since site names are often cryptic enough to
          make it hard to recognize the organization by the electronic  ad-
          dress.

          2.2.9.  Keywords

               A few,  well  selected  keywords  identifying  this  article
          should  be on this line. This is used as an aid in determining if
          this article is interesting to the reader.

9          2.2.10.  Summary

               This line (lines) should contain a brief summary of the  ar-
          ticle.  It is usually used as part of a followup to another arti-
          cle. Again, it is very useful to the reader in determining wheth-
          er to read the article.

          2.2.11.  Approved

               This line is required for any message posted to a  moderated
          newsgroup.   It  should  be added by the moderator and consist of
          his mail address.

          2.2.12.  Lines

               This contains a count of the number of lines in the article.

          2.2.13.  Xref

               This line contains the name of the site (with domains  omit-
          ted) and a white space separated list of colon separated pairs of
          newsgroup names and article numbers,  these  are  the  newsgroups
          listed  in  the  "Newsgroups"  line and the corresponding article
          numbers from the spool directory.

          2.2.14.  NF-ID

               This line is inserted by the _n_o_t_e_s_f_i_l_e system and is not  of
          any use to programs following this standard.

          2.2.15.  NF-From

               This is another _n_o_t_e_s_f_i_l_e inserted header that is ignored by
          everything except notesfiles.

          3.  Control Messages

               This section lists the control messages  currently  defined.
          The  body  of  the "Control" header is the control message.  Mes-
          sages are a sequence of zero or more words,  separated  by  white
          space  (blanks  or tabs).  The first word is the name of the con-
          trol message, remaining words are parameters to the message.  The
          remainder  of the header and the body of the message are also po-
          tential parameters; for example, the "From" line might suggest an
          address to which a response is to be mailed.

               Implementors and administrators may choose to allow  control
          messages  to  be  carried out automatically, or to queue them for
          manual processing.  However, manually processed  messages  should
          be dealt with promptly.

               Failed control messages should NOT be mailed to the origina-
          tor of the message, but to the local "usenet" account.

9          3.1.  Cancel

               cancel <Message-ID>

          If an article with the given Message-ID is present on  the  local
          system,  the  article is cancelled.  This mechanism allows a user
          to cancel an article after the article has been distributed  over
          the network.

               If the system is unable to cancel the article as  requested,
          it  should  not  forward the cancellation request to its neighbor
          systems.

               Only the author of the article or the local  super  user  is
          allowed to use this message.  The verified sender of a message is
          the "Sender" line, or if no "Sender" line is present, the  "From"
          line.  The verified sender of the cancel message must be the same
          as either the "Sender" or "From" field of the  original  message.
          A  verified  sender  in the cancel message is allowed to match an
          unverified "From" in the original message.

          3.2.  Ihave/Sendme

               ihave <Message-ID list> <remotesys>
               sendme <Message-ID list> <remotesys>

          This message is part of the _i_h_a_v_e/_s_e_n_d_m_e protocol,  which  allows
          one  site (say _A) to tell another site (_B) that a particular mes-
          sage has been received on _A.  Suppose that site _A receives  arti-
          cle  "<1234@ucbvax.Berkeley.edu>", and wishes to transmit the ar-
          ticle  to  site  _B.   _A  sends   the   control   message   "ihave
          <1234@ucbvax.Berkeley.edu>  A"  to site _B (by posting it to news-
          group  to._B_B).   _B  responds  with  the  control  message  "sendme
          <1234@ucbvax.Berkeley.edu>  B"  (on newsgroup to._A_A) if it has not
          already received the article.  Upon receiving the _s_e_n_d_m_e message,
          _A sends the article to _B.

               This protocol can be used to cut down on  redundant  traffic
          between  sites.   It  is  optional and should be used only if the
          particular situation makes it worthwhile.  Frequently,  the  out-
          come  is  that, since most original messages are short, and since
          there is a high overhead to start  sending  a  new  message  with
          UUCP, it costs as much to send the _i_h_a_v_e as it would cost to send
          the article itself.

               One possible solution to this overhead problem is  to  batch
          requests.   Several Message-ID's may be announced or requested in
          one message.  If no Message-ID's are listed in the  control  mes-
          sage, the body of the message should be scanned for Message-ID's,
          one per line.

9          3.3.  Newgroup

               newgroup <groupname> [moderated]

               This control message creates a new newsgroup with  the  name
          given.   Since  no  articles  may  be posted or forwarded until a
          newsgroup is created, this message is required before a newsgroup
          can  be  used.  The body of the message is expected to be a short
          paragraph describing the intended use of the newsgroup.

               If the  second  argument  is  present  and  is  the  keyword
          _m_o_d_e_r_a_t_e_d,  the  group should be created moderated instead of the
          default unmoderated.  The newgroup message should be ignored  un-
          less there is an "Approved" line in the same message header.

          3.4.  Rmgroup

               rmgroup <groupname>

               This message removes a newsgroup with the given name.  Since
          the  newsgroup  is  removed  from every site on the network, this
          command should be used carefully by a responsible  administrator.
          The  rmgroup  message  should  be ignored unless there is an "Ap-
          proved:" line in the same message header.

          3.5.  Sendsys

               sendsys (no arguments)

               The _s_y_s file, listing all neighbors and which newsgroups are
          sent  to  each neighbor, will be mailed to the author of the con-
          trol message ("Reply-to", if present,  otherwise  "From").   This
          information  is  considered  public  information, and it is a re-
          quirement of membership in USENET that this information  be  pro-
          vided  on  request, either automatically in response to this con-
          trol message, or manually, by mailing the  requested  information
          to  the  author of the message.  This information is used to keep
          the map of USENET up to date, and to determine where  netnews  is
          sent.

               The format of the file mailed back to the author  should  be
          the  same  as that of the _s_y_s file.  This format has one line per
          neighboring site (plus one line for the local  site),  containing
          four  colon  separated fields.  The first field has the site name
          of the  neighbor,  the  second  field  has  a  newsgroup  pattern
          describing  the  newsgroups  sent to the neighbor.  The third and
          fourth fields  are  not  defined  by  this  standard.   A  sample
          response is:

          3.6.  Senduuname

               senduuname      (no arguments)

          The _u_u_n_a_m_e(1) program is run, and the output is mailed to the au-
          thor  of  the  control message ("Reply-to", if present, otherwise
          "From").  This program lists all  UUCP  neighbors  of  the  local
          site.  This information is used to make maps of the UUCP network.
          The _s_y_s file is not the same as the UUCP _L._s_y_s file.   The  _L._s_y_s
          file  should  never  be  transmitted to another party without the
          consent of the sites whose passwords are listed therein.

               It is optional for a site to provide this information.  Some
          reply  should  be  made  to the author of the control message, so
          that a transmission error won't be blamed.  It is also  permissi-
          ble  for  a  site to run the _u_u_n_a_m_e program (or in some other way
          determine the UUCP neighbors) and edit  the  output,  either  au-
          tomatically or manually, before mailing the reply back to the au-
          thor.  The file should contain one site per line, beginning  with
          the  UUCP  site  name.   Additional  information may be included,
          separated from the site name by a blank or tab.  The phone number
          or  password for the site should not be included, as the reply is
          considered to be in the public domain.  (The _u_u_n_a_m_e program  will
          send  only the site name and not the entire contents of the _L._s_y_s
          file, thus, phone numbers and passwords are not transmitted.)

               The purpose of this message was  to  generate  and  maintain
          UUCP mail routing maps.  Thus, connections over which mail can be
          sent using the "site!user" syntax should be included,  regardless
          of  whether the link is actually a UUCP link at the physical lev-
          el.  If a mail router should  use  it,  it  should  be  included.
          Since all information sent in response to this message is option-
          al, sites are free to edit the list, deleting secret  or  private
          links they do not wish to publicize.  It is not used any more.

9          present, otherwise "From").

          3.8.  checkgroups

               The message body is a  list  of  "official"  newsgroups  and
          their description, one group per line.  They are compared against
          the  list of active newsgroups on the current site. The names  of
          any  obsolete  or  new newsgroups are mailed to the used "usenet"
          and descriptions  of the new newsgroups are  added  to  the  help
          file used when posting news.

          4.  Transmission Methods

               USENET is not a physical network, but rather a logical  net-
          work resting on top of several existing physical networks.  These
          networks include, but are not limited to, UUCP, the  ARPANET,  an
          Ethernet,  the BLICN network, an NSC Hyperchannel, and a BERKNET.
          What is important is that two neighboring systems on USENET  have
          some method to get a new article, in the format listed here, from
          one system to the other, and once on the receiving  system,  pro-
          cessed by the netnews software on that system.   (On  UNIX8*9  sys-
          tems, this usually means the _r_n_e_w_s program being run with the ar-
          ticle on the standard input.)

               It is not a requirement that USENET sites have mail  systems
          capable of understanding the ARPA Internet mail syntax, but it is
          strongly recommended.  Since  "From",  "Reply-To",  and  "Sender"
          lines  use  the Internet syntax, replies will be difficult or im-
          possible without an internet mailer.  A site without an  internet
          mailer can attempt to use the "Path" header line for replies, but
          this field is not guaranteed to be a working  path  for  replies.
          In  any  event,  any  site generating or forwarding news messages
          must have an internet address that allows them  to  receive  mail
          from sites with internet mailers, and they must include their in-
          ternet address on their From line.

          4.1.  Remote Execution

               Some networks permit direct remote  command  execution.   On
          these  networks, news may be forwarded by spooling the _r_n_e_w_s com-
          mand with the article on the standard input.  For example, if the
          remote  system  is  called _r_e_m_o_t_e, news would be sent over a UUCP
          link with the command

                                 uux - remote!rnews

          and on a Berknet,

                                 net -mremote rnews

          It  is  important  that  the  article  be  sent  via  a  reliable

9          mechanism, normally involving the possibility of spooling, rather
          than  direct real-time remote execution.  This is because, if the
          remote system is down, a direct execution command will fail,  and
          the  article will never be delivered.  If the article is spooled,
          it will eventually be delivered when both systems are up.

          4.2.  Transfer by Mail

               On some systems, direct remote spooled execution is not pos-
          sible.  However, most systems support electronic mail, and a news
          article can be sent as mail.  One approach is to send a mail mes-
          sage which is identical to the news message: the mail headers are
          the news headers, and the mail body is the news body.  By conven-
          tion,  this  mail  is  sent  to  the  user _n_e_w_s_m_a_i_l on the remote
          machine.

               One problem with this method is that it may not be  possible
          to  convince  the mail system that the "From" line of the message
          is valid, since the mail message was generated by a program on  a
          system  different  from  the source of the news article.  Another
          problem is that error messages caused by  the  mail  transmission
          would  be  sent to the originator of the news article, who has no
          control over news transmission between two cooperating hosts  and
          does not know who to contact.  Transmission error messages should
          be directed to  a  responsible  contact  person  on  the  sending
          machine.

               A solution to this problem is to encapsulate the news  arti-
          cle  into  a  mail message, such that the entire article (headers
          and body) are part of the body of the mail message.  The  conven-
          tion  here  is that such mail is sent to user _r_n_e_w_s on the remote
          system.  A mail message  body  is  generated  by  prepending  the
          letter  N  to  each  line of the news article, and then attaching
          whatever mail headers are convenient to generate.   The  N's  are
          attached  to  prevent  any special lines in the news article from
          interfering with mail transmission,  and  to  prevent  any  extra
          lines  inserted  by  the mailer (headers, blank lines, etc.) from
          becoming part of the news article.  A program  on  the  receiving
          machine receives mail to _r_n_e_w_s, extracting the article itself and
          invoking the _r_n_e_w_s program.  An example in this format might look
          like this:

               Using mail solves the spooling problem, since mail must  al-
          ways  be  spooled  if  the destination host is down.  However, it
          adds more overhead to the transmission  process  (to  encapsulate
          and extract the article) and makes it harder for software to give
          different priorities to news and mail.

          4.3.  Batching

               Since news articles are usually short,  and  since  a  large
          number  of messages are often sent between two sites in a day, it
          may make sense to batch news articles.  Several articles  can  be
          combined into one large article, using conventions agreed upon in
          advance by the two sites.  One such batching scheme is  described
          here; its use is highly recommended.

               News articles are combined into a  script,  separated  by  a
          header of the form:

               #! rnews 1234

          where _1_2_3_4 is the length, in bytes, of the  article.   Each  such
          line  is  followed  by  an article containing the given number of
          bytes.  (The newline at the end of each line of  the  article  is
          counted  as  one  byte, for purposes of this count, even if it is
          stored as <CARRIAGE RETURN><LINE FEED>.) For example, a batch  of
          articles might look like this:

               There was something I forgot to mention in the last message.

          Batched news is recognized because the  first  character  in  the
          message  is  #.   The message is then passed to the unbatcher for
          interpretation.

               The second argument  (in  this  example  _r_n_e_w_s),  determines
          which  batching  scheme  is being used. Cooperating sites may use
          whatever scheme is appropriate for them.

          5.  The News Propagation Algorithm

               This section describes the overall scheme of USENET and  the
          algorithm  followed  by  sites  in propagating news to the entire
          network.  Since all sites are affected by  incorrectly  formatted
          articles  and  by  propagation  errors,  it  is important for the
          method to be standardized.

               USENET is a directed graph.  Each node in  the  graph  is  a
          host  computer,  and each arc in the graph is a transmission path
          from one host to another host.  Each arc is labeled with a  news-
          group  pattern,  specifying which newsgroup classes are forwarded
          along that link.  Most arcs are bidirectional, that is, if site _A
          sends  a class of newsgroups to site _B, then site _B usually sends
          the same class of newsgroups to site _A.  This bidirectionality is
          not, however, required.

               USENET is made up of many subnetworks.  Each  subnet  has  a
          name,  such  as  comp  or btl.  Each subnet is a connected graph,
          that is, a path exists from every node to every other node in the
          subnet.   In  addition,  the entire graph is (theoretically) con-
          nected.  (In practice, some political considerations have  caused
          some sites to be unable to post articles reaching the rest of the
          network.)

               An article is posted on one machine to a list of newsgroups.
          That  machine  accepts  it  locally,  then forwards it to all its

9          neighbors that are interested in at least one of  the  newsgroups
          of  the  message.   (Site  _A deems site _B to be "interested" in a
          newsgroup if the newsgroup matches the pattern on the arc from  _A
          to  _B.   This  pattern is stored in a file on the _A machine.) The
          sites receiving the incoming article examine it to make sure they
          really want the article, accept it locally, and then in turn for-
          ward the article to all _t_h_e_i_r interested neighbors.  This process
          continues until the entire network has seen the article.

               An important part of the  algorithm  is  the  prevention  of
          loops.   The  above process would cause a message to loop along a
          cycle forever.  In particular, when site _A sends  an  article  to
          site _B, site _B will send it back to site _A, which will send it to
          site _B, and so on.  One solution to this is the  history  mechan-
          ism.  Each site keeps track of all articles it has seen (by their
          Message-ID) and whenever an article comes in that it has  already
          seen,  the incoming article is discarded immediately.  This solu-
          tion is sufficient to prevent loops, but additional optimizations
          can  be  made to avoid sending articles to sites that will simply
          throw them away.

               One optimization is that an article should never be sent  to
          a  machine  listed  in  the  "Path"  line  of the header.  When a
          machine name is in the "Path" line, the message is known to  have
          passed through the machine.  Another optimization is that, if the
          article originated on site _A, then site _A has  already  seen  the
          article.   Thus,  if an article is posted to newsgroup misc.misc,
          it will match the pattern misc.all (where  all  is  a  metasymbol
          that matches any string), and will be forwarded to all sites that
          subscribe to misc.all (as determined by what their neighbors send
          them).   These  sites  make  up  the misc subnetwork.  An article
          posted to btl.general will reach all sites receiving btl.all, but
          will not reach sites that do not get btl.all.  In effect, the ar-
          ticles reaches the btl subnetwork.  An article  posted  to  news-
          groups  misc.misc,btl.general will reach all sites subscribing to
          either of the two classes.

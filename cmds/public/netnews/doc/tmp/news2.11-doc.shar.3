	X.TH MN 7 "News Version B2.11"
	X.SH NAME
	Xmn \- text formatting macros for the news documentation
	X.SH SYNOPSIS
	X.B "nroff  \-mn"
	X[ options ]  file  ...
	X.br
	X.B "troff  \-mn"
	X[ options ]  file  ...
	X.SH DESCRIPTION
	X.PP
	XThis package of
	X.IR nroff (1)
	Xand
	X.IR troff (1)
	Xmacro definitions provides a formatting facility
	Xwhich may be used to run off the formatted news documents.
	XWhen reverse line motions are needed,
	Xfilter the output through
	X.IR col (1).
	X.PP
	XAll \-mn macros,
	Xdiversions,
	Xstring registers,
	Xand number registers are defined below.
	XMany
	X.I nroff
	Xand
	X.I troff
	Xrequests are unsafe in conjunction with this package.
	XHowever,
	Xthe requests below may be used with impunity:
	X.LP
	X.ta 5n 12n
	X.nf
	X	.bp	begin new page
	X	.br	break output line
	X	.sp \f2n\fP	insert \f2n\fP spacing lines
	X	.ce \f2n\fP	center next \f2n\fP lines
	X	.ls \f2n\fP	line spacing: \f2n\fP=1 single, \f2n\fP=2 double space
	X	.na	no alignment of right margin
	X.fi
	X.PP
	XFont and point size changes with \ef and \es are also allowed;
	Xfor example,
	X\&``\ef2word\efR'' will italicize \f2word.\fP
	XOutput of the
	X.IR tbl (1),
	X.IR eqn (1),
	Xand
	X.IR refer (1)
	Xpreprocessors for equations,
	Xtables,
	Xand references is acceptable as input.
	X.SH FILES
	X/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.n
	X.SH "SEE ALSO"
	Xeqn(1), refer(1), tbl(1), troff(1)
	X.SH WARNINGS
	X.PP
	XIf you do not set the string register ``.f'' to the file name,
	Xyou will only be told the line number on which any errors occur.
	XIf you define this string to be the file name,
	Xyou will get the file name,
	Xtoo.
	XThis is useful when dealing with a document
	Xsplit up into many files.
	X.PP
	XThis package is not now intended for uses
	Xother than with the news documentation.
	X.PP
	XBug reports are always welcome;
	Xplease send them to the author.
	X(Include a sample of the input;
	Xthis helps track down the bug.)

	XIntroduction
	X.pg
	XThis document defines the standard format for the interchange
	Xof network News articles among USENET sites.
	XIt describes the format for articles themselves,
	Xand gives partial standards for transmission of news.
	XThe news transmission is not entirely standardized
	Xin order to give a good deal of flexibility
	Xto the individual hosts to choose transmission hardware and software,
	Xwhether to batch news,
	Xand so on.
	X.pg
	XThere are five sections to this document.
	XSection two section defines the format.
	XSection three defines the valid control messages.
	XSection four specifies some valid transmission methods.
	XSection five describes the overall news propagation algorithm.
	X.hn
	XArticle Format
	X.pg
	XThe primary consideration in choosing an article format is
	Xthat it fit in with existing tools as well as possible.
	XExisting tools include both implementations of mail and news.
	X(The
	X.i notesfiles
	Xsystem from the University of Illinois
	Xis considered a news implementation.)
	XA standard format for mail messages has existed for many years on the ARPANET,
	Xand this format meets most of the needs of USENET.
	XSince the ARPANET format is extensible,
	Xextensions to meet the additional needs of USENET
	Xare easily made within the ARPANET standard.
	XTherefore,
	Xthe rule is adopted that all USENET news articles
	Xmust be formatted as valid ARPANET mail messages,
	Xaccording to the ARPANET standard RFC 822.
	XThis standard is more restrictive than the ARPANET standard,
	Xplacing additional requirements on each article
	Xand forbidding use of certain ARPANET features.
	XHowever,
	Xit should always be possible to use a tool
	Xexpecting an ARPANET message to process a news article.
	XIn any situation where this standard conflicts with the ARPANET standard,
	XRFC 822 should be considered correct and this standard in error.
	X.pg
	XAn example message is included to illustrate the fields.

	XUsenet Etiquette - Please Read
	XThe body of the article comes here, with no blank line.
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XAn article consists of several header lines,
	Xfollowed by a blank line,
	Xfollowed by the body of the message.
	XThe header lines consist of a keyword,
	Xa colon,
	Xa blank,
	Xand some additional information.
	XThis is a subset of the ARPANET standard,
	Xsimplified to allow simpler software to handle it.
	XThe
	X.hf From
	Xline may optionally include a full name,
	Xin the format above,
	Xor use the ARPANET angle bracket syntax.
	XTo keep the implementations simple,
	Xother formats
	X(for example,
	Xwith part of the machine address after the close parenthesis)
	Xare not allowed.
	XThe ARPANET convention of continuation header lines
	X(beginning with a blank or tab)
	Xis allowed.
	X.pg
	XCertain headers are required,
	Xand certain other headers are optional.
	XAny unrecognized headers are allowed,
	Xand will be passed through unchanged.
	XThe required headers are
	X.hf From ,
	X.hf Date ,
	X.hf Newsgroups ,
	X.hf Subject ,
	X.hf Message-ID ,
	Xand
	X.hf Path .
	XThe optional headers are
	X.hf Followup-To ,
	X.hf Expires ,
	X.hf Reply-To ,
	X.hf Sender ,
	X.hf References ,
	X.hf Control ,
	X.hf Distribution ,
	X.hf Keywords ,
	X.hf Summary ,
	X.hf Approved ,
	X.hf Lines ,
	X.hf Xref ,
	X.hf Nf-ID ,
	X.hf Nf-From ,
	Xand
	X.hf Organization .
	X.hn 2
	XRequired Headers
	X.hn 3
	XFrom
	X.pg
	XThe
	X.hf From
	Xline contains the electronic mailing address of the person who sent the message,
	Xin the ARPA internet syntax.
	XIt may optionally also contain the full name of the person,
	Xin parentheses,
	Xafter the electronic address.
	XThe electronic address is the same as the entity responsible
	Xfor originating the article,
	Xunless the
	X.hf Sender
	Xheader is present,
	Xin which case the
	X.hf From
	Xheader might not be verified.
	XNote that in all site and domain names,
	Xupper and lower case are considered the same,
	Xthus
	X.cf mark@cbosgd.UUCP ,
	X.cf mark@cbosgd.uucp ,
	Xand
	X.cf mark@CBosgD.UUcp
	Xare all equivalent.
	XUser names may or may not be case sensitive, for example,
	X.cf Billy@cbosgd.UUCP
	Xmight be different from
	X.cf BillY@cbosgd.UUCP .
	XPrograms should avoid changing the case of electronic addresses
	Xwhen forwarding news or mail.
	X.pg
	XRFC 822 specifies that all text in parentheses is to be interpreted as a comment.
	XIt is common in ARPANET mail to place the full name of the user
	Xin a comment at the end of the
	X.hf From
	Xline.
	XThis standard specifies a more rigid syntax.
	XThe full name is not considered a comment,
	Xbut an optional part of the header line.
	XEither the full name is omitted, 
	Xor it appears in parentheses after the electronic address
	Xof the person posting the article,
	Xor it appears before an electronic address enclosed in angle brackets.
	XThus,
	Xthe three permissible forms are:
	X.sd
	XFrom: mark@cbosgd.UUCP
	XFrom: mark@cbosgd.UUCP (Mark Horton)
	XFrom: Mark Horton <mark@cbosgd.UUCP>
	X.ed
	XFull names may contain any printing ASCII characters from space through tilde,
	Xexcept that they may not contain
	X\&\*(lq(\*(rq (left parenthesis),
	X\&\*(lq)\*(rq (right parenthesis),
	X\&\*(lq<\*(rq (left angle bracket),
	Xor \*(lq>\*(rq (right angle bracket).
	XAdditional restrictions may be placed on full names by the mail standard,
	Xin particular,
	Xthe characters
	X\&\*(lq,\*(rq (comma),
	X\&\*(lq:\*(rq (colon),
	Xand \*(lq;\*(rq (semicolon) are inadvisable in full names.
	X.hn 3
	XDate
	X.pg
	XThe
	X.hf Date
	Xline (formerly
	X.hf Posted )
	Xis the date,
	Xin a format that must be acceptable both to the ARPANET
	Xand to the
	X.i getdate (3)
	Xroutine,
	Xthat the article was originally posted to the network.
	XThis date remains unchanged as the article is propagated
	Xthroughout the network.
	XOne format that is acceptable to both is
	X.sd c
	X\f2Wdy\fP, \f2DD\fP\ \f2Mon\fP\ \f2YY\fP \f2HH\fP:\f2MM\fP:\f2SS\fP \f2TIMEZONE\fP
	X.ed
	XSeveral examples of valid dates appear in the sample
	Xarticle above.
	XNote in particular that
	X.i ctime (3)
	Xformat:
	X.sd c
	X\f2Wdy\fP \f2Mon\fP \f2DD\fP \f2HH\fP:\f2MM\fP:\f2SS\fP \f2YYYY\fP
	X.ed
	Xis
	X.i not
	Xacceptable because it is not a valid ARPANET date.
	XHowever,
	Xsince older software still generates this format,
	Xnews implementations are encouraged to accept this format
	Xand translate it into an acceptable format.
	X.pg
	XThe contents of the
	X.i TIMEZONE
	Xfield is currently subject to revision.
	XEventually,
	Xwe hope to accept all possible worldwide time zone abbreviations,
	Xincluding the usual American zones
	X(PST,
	XPDT,
	XMST,
	XMDT,
	XCST,
	XCDT,
	XEST,
	XEDT),
	Xthe other North American zones
	X(Bering through Newfoundland),
	XEuropean zones,
	XAustralian zones,
	Xand so on.
	XLacking a complete list at present
	X(and unsure if an unambiguous list exists),
	Xauthors of software are encouraged to keep this code flexible,
	Xand in particular not to assume
	Xthat time zone names are exactly three letters long.
	XImplementations are free to edit this field,
	Xkeeping the time the same,
	Xbut changing the time zone
	X(with an appropriate adjustment to the local time shown)
	Xto a known time zone.

	XTransmission Methods
	X.pg
	XUSENET is not a physical network,
	Xbut rather a logical network
	Xresting on top of several existing physical networks.
	XThese networks include,
	Xbut are not limited to,
	XUUCP,
	Xthe ARPANET,
	Xan Ethernet,
	Xthe BLICN network,
	Xan NSC Hyperchannel,
	Xand a BERKNET.
	XWhat is important is that two neighboring systems on USENET
	Xhave some method to get a new article,
	Xin the format listed here,
	Xfrom one system to the other,
	Xand once on the receiving system,
	Xprocessed by the netnews software on that system.
	X(On
	X.ux
	Xsystems,
	Xthis usually means the
	X.i rnews
	Xprogram being run with the article on the standard input.)
	X.pg
	XIt is not a requirement that USENET sites have mail systems
	Xcapable of understanding the ARPA Internet mail syntax,
	Xbut it is strongly recommended.
	XSince
	X.hf From ,
	X.hf Reply-To ,
	Xand
	X.hf Sender
	Xlines use the Internet syntax, 
	Xreplies will be difficult or impossible without an internet mailer.
	XA site without an internet mailer can attempt to use the
	X.hf Path
	Xheader line for replies,
	Xbut this field is not guaranteed to be a working path for replies.
	XIn any event,
	Xany site generating or forwarding news messages
	Xmust have an internet address that allows them
	Xto receive mail from sites with internet mailers,
	Xand they must include their internet address on their From line.
	X.hn 2
	XRemote Execution
	X.pg
	XSome networks permit direct remote command execution.
	XOn these networks,
	Xnews may be forwarded by spooling the
	X.i rnews
	Xcommand with the article on the standard input.
	XFor example,
	Xif the remote system is called
	X.cn remote ,
	Xnews would be sent over a UUCP link with the command
	X.sd c
	Xuux \- remote!rnews
	X.ed
	Xand on a Berknet,
	X.sd c
	Xnet \-mremote rnews
	X.ed
	XIt is important that the article be sent via a reliable mechanism,
	Xnormally involving the possibility of spooling,
	Xrather than direct real-time remote execution.
	XThis is because,
	Xif the remote system is down,
	Xa direct execution command will fail,
	Xand the article will never be delivered.
	XIf the article is spooled,
	Xit will eventually be delivered when both systems are up.
	X.hn 2
	XTransfer by Mail
	X.pg
	XOn some systems,
	Xdirect remote spooled execution is not possible.
	XHowever,
	Xmost systems support electronic mail,
	Xand a news article can be sent as mail.
	XOne approach is to send a mail message
	Xwhich is identical to the news message:
	Xthe mail headers are the news headers,
	Xand the mail body is the news body.
	XBy convention,
	Xthis mail is sent to the user
	X.i newsmail
	Xon the remote machine.
	X.pg
	XOne problem with this method is that it may not be possible to convince
	Xthe mail system that the
	X.hf From
	Xline of the message is valid,
	Xsince the mail message was generated by a program
	Xon a system different from the source of the news article.
	XAnother problem is that error messages caused by the mail transmission
	Xwould be sent to the originator of the news article,
	Xwho has no control over news transmission between two cooperating hosts
	Xand does not know who to contact.
	XTransmission error messages should be directed to a responsible
	Xcontact person on the sending machine.
	X.pg
	XA solution to this problem is to encapsulate the news article
	Xinto a mail message,
	Xsuch that the entire article
	X(headers and body)
	Xare part of the body of the mail message.
	XThe convention here is that such mail is sent to user
	X.i rnews
	Xon the remote system.
	XA mail message body is generated by prepending the letter
	X.qp N
	Xto each line of the news article,
	Xand then attaching whatever mail headers are convenient to generate.
	XThe
	X.qp N 's
	Xare attached to prevent any special lines in the news article
	Xfrom interfering with mail transmission,
	Xand to prevent any extra lines inserted by the mailer
	X(headers,
	Xblank lines,
	Xetc.)
	Xfrom becoming part of the news article.
	XA program on the receiving machine receives mail to
	X.i rnews ,
	Xextracting the article itself and invoking the
	X.i rnews
	Xprogram.
	XAn example in this format might look like this:
	X.sd
	XDate: Monday, 3 Jan 83 08:33:47 MST
	XFrom: news@cbosgd.UUCP
	XSubject: network news article

	XNThis really is a test.  If anyone out there more than 6 
	XNhops away would kindly confirm this note I would
	XNappreciate it.  We suspect that our news postings
	XNare not getting out into the world.
	XN
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XUsing mail solves the spooling problem,
	Xsince mail must always be spooled if the destination host is down.
	XHowever,
	Xit adds more overhead to the transmission process
	X(to encapsulate and extract the article)
	Xand makes it harder for software to give different priorities
	Xto news and mail.
	X.hn 2
	XBatching
	X.pg
	XSince news articles are usually short,
	Xand since a large number of messages
	Xare often sent between two sites in a day,
	Xit may make sense to batch news articles.
	XSeveral articles can be combined into one large article,
	Xusing conventions agreed upon in advance by the two sites.
	XOne such batching scheme is described here;
	Xits use is highly recommended.
	X.pg
	XNews articles are combined into a script, separated by a header of the form:
	X.sd
	X#! rnews 1234
	X.ed
	Xwhere
	X.i 1234
	Xis the length,
	Xin bytes,
	Xof the article.
	XEach such line is followed by an article containing the given number of bytes.
	X(The newline at the end of each line of the article is counted as one byte,
	Xfor purposes of this count, even if it is stored as
	X.qc "CARRIAGE RETURN\s+2><\s-2LINE FEED" \&.)
	XFor example,
	Xa batch of articles might look like this:
	X.sd
	X#! rnews 207
	XFrom: jerry@eagle.uucp (Jerry Schwarz)
	XPath: cbosgd!mhuxj!mhuxt!eagle!jerry

	X.ed
	XBatched news is recognized because the first character in the message is
	X.qp # .
	XThe message is then passed to the unbatcher for interpretation.
	X.pg
	XThe second argument (in this example
	X.i rnews ),
	Xdetermines which batching scheme is being used. Cooperating sites
	Xmay use whatever scheme is appropriate for them.
	X.hn 1
	XThe News Propagation Algorithm
	X.pg
	XThis section describes the overall scheme of USENET and the algorithm
	Xfollowed by sites in propagating news to the entire network.
	XSince all sites are affected by incorrectly formatted articles
	Xand by propagation errors,
	Xit is important for the method to be standardized.
	X.pg
	XUSENET is a directed graph.
	XEach node in the graph is a host computer,
	Xand each arc in the graph is a transmission path
	Xfrom one host to another host.
	XEach arc is labeled with a newsgroup pattern,
	Xspecifying which newsgroup classes are forwarded along that link.
	XMost arcs are bidirectional,
	Xthat is,
	Xif site
	X.cn A
	Xsends a class of newsgroups to site
	X.cn B ,
	Xthen site
	X.cn B
	Xusually sends the same class of newsgroups to site
	X.cn A .
	XThis bidirectionality is not,
	Xhowever,
	Xrequired.
	X.pg
	XUSENET is made up of many subnetworks.
	XEach subnet has a name,
	Xsuch as
	X.ng comp
	Xor
	X.ng btl .
	XEach subnet is a connected graph,
	Xthat is,
	Xa path exists from every node to every other node in the subnet.
	XIn addition,
	Xthe entire graph is
	X(theoretically)
	Xconnected.
	X(In practice,
	Xsome political considerations have caused some sites
	Xto be unable to post articles reaching the rest of the network.)
	X.pg
	XAn article is posted on one machine to a list of newsgroups.
	XThat machine accepts it locally,
	Xthen forwards it to all its neighbors that are interested
	Xin at least one of the newsgroups of the message.
	X(Site
	X.cn A
	Xdeems site
	X.cn B
	Xto be \*(lqinterested\*(rq in a newsgroup
	Xif the newsgroup matches the pattern on the arc from
	X.cn A
	Xto
	X.cn B .
	XThis pattern is stored in a file on the
	X.cn A
	Xmachine.)
	XThe sites receiving the incoming article examine it
	Xto make sure they really want the article,
	Xaccept it locally,
	Xand then in turn forward the article to all
	X.i their
	Xinterested neighbors.
	XThis process continues until the entire network has seen the article.
	X.pg
	XAn important part of the algorithm is the prevention of loops.
	XThe above process would cause a message to loop along a cycle forever.
	XIn particular,
	Xwhen site
	X.cn A
	Xsends an article to site
	X.cn B ,
	Xsite
	X.cn B
	Xwill send it back to site
	X.cn A ,
	Xwhich will send it to site
	X.cn B ,
	Xand so on.
	XOne solution to this is the history mechanism.
	XEach site keeps track of all articles it has seen
	X(by their Message-ID)
	Xand whenever an article comes in that it has already seen,
	Xthe incoming article is discarded immediately.
	XThis solution is sufficient to prevent loops,
	Xbut additional optimizations can be made to avoid sending articles to sites
	Xthat will simply throw them away.
	X.pg
	XOne optimization is that an article should never be sent to a machine
	Xlisted in the
	X.hf Path
	Xline of the header.
	XWhen a machine name is in the
	X.hf Path
	Xline,
	Xthe message is known to have passed through the machine.
	XAnother optimization is that,
	Xif the article originated on site
	X.cn A ,
	Xthen site
	X.cn A
	Xhas already seen the article.
	X.P
	XThus,
	Xif an article is posted to newsgroup
	X.ng misc.misc ,
	Xit will match the pattern
	X.ng misc.all
	X(where
	X.ng all
	Xis a metasymbol that matches any string),
	Xand will be forwarded to all sites that subscribe to
	X.ng misc.all
	X(as determined by what their neighbors send them).
	XThese sites make up the
	X.ng misc
	Xsubnetwork.
	XAn article posted to
	X.ng btl.general
	Xwill reach all sites receiving
	X.ng btl.all ,
	Xbut will not reach sites that do not get
	X.ng btl.all .
	XIn effect,
	Xthe articles reaches the
	X.ng btl
	Xsubnetwork.
	XAn article posted to newsgroups
	X.ng misc.misc,btl.general
	Xwill reach all sites subscribing to either of the two classes.

	X.\" here's an overview:
	X.\"	Footnotes are processed in environment #1, which is  initialized
	X.\"	at the bottom of this package.  When "fn" is called, nroff/troff
	X.\"	switches to this environment.  The body of the footnote is saved
	X.\"	in  the  diversion  "tf" (for "temporary footnote"), so you will
	X.\"	NEVER spring a trap during the first reading of a footnote. When
	X.\"	"ef" ("end footnote" is called,  the  diversion  is  closed.  If
	X.\"	this  is the first footnote on the page (ie, the number register
	X.\"	"fc" is 1), and the footnote height (plus the height of 1  line)
	X.\"	crosses  the  bottom  margin,  you get the footnoted word on one
	X.\"	page and the footnote on the other.  In this case we  just  call
	X.\"	"fo"  manually  (taking case it cannot be re-invoked on the same
	X.\"	page!)  If this situation does not occur,  we  just  adjust  the
	X.\"	footer  trap's  position upwards (we'll get to how far in a min-
	X.\"	ute); if this puts the trap above the current line,  we  reposi-
	X.\"	tion  the trap just beneath the current line to be sure of trig-
	X.\"	triggering it once the current line is forced out.
	X.\"	 To reposition the footer trap, we proceed as  follows.  Because
	X.\"	the  trap  may be sprung in the middle of a line, it is possible
	X.\"	that the footnote will not fit on the page (regardless of  where
	X.\"	on the page the footnoted word occurs -- really!) if we move the
	X.\"	trap up by the size of  the  footnote  diversion  "tf".  So,  we
	X.\"	fudge things a little bit -- for the first footnote on each page
	X.\"	we move the footer trap up 1 extra line ("line" being 1v in env-
	X.\"	ironment  #0).   Unless  the point size and vertical spacing are
	X.\"	increased between the first footnote and the footer trap's being
	X.\"	sprung,  this  will  keep  the footnotes on the same page as the
	X.\"	footnoted word.  But as there may be now as much as 1v of  space
	X.\"	between the footnote and the bottom margin, which looks HIDEOUS,
	X.\"	we use the number register "fs" to mark where  the  footer  trap
	X.\"	would  REALLY go, and just space to it when it comes time to put
	X.\"	out the footnotes.

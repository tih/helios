	XI am an attorney practicing copyright law and computer
	Xlaw.  I read a series of queries in net.legal about
	Xcopyright law and was dismayed to find that people who
	Xhad no idea what they were talking about were spreading
	Xmisinformation over the network.  Considering that the
	Xpenalties for copyright infringement can include
	X$50,000.00 damages per infringed work, attorneys fees,
	Xcourt costs, criminal fines and imprisonment, and
	Xconsidering that ignorance is no excuse and innocent
	Xintent is not even a recognized defense, I cringe to see
	Xthe network used as a soapbox for the ill-informed.  For
	Xthat reason, this article will discuss copyright law and
	Xlicense law as they pertain to computer software.
	X.pg
	XMy goal is to enable readers to determine when they
	Xshould be concerned about infringing and when they can
	Xrelax about it.  I also want to let programmers know how
	Xto obtain copyright for their work.  I'll explain the
	Xpurpose of software licenses, and discuss the effect
	Xthat the license has on copyright.  For those of you who
	Xare programmers, I'll help you decide whether you own
	Xthe programs you write on the job or your boss owns
	Xthem.  I will also mention trademark law and patent law
	Xbriefly, in order to clarify some confusion about which
	Xis which.  Incidentally, if you read this entire essay,
	Xyou will be able to determine whether or not the essay
	Xis copyrighted and whether or not you can make a
	Xprintout of it.

	XA bit of history
	X.pg
	XIf you're not interested in history, you can
	Xskip this paragraph.
	X.i Modern
	Xcopyright law first came
	Xinto existence in 1570,  by an act of Parliament called
	Xthe Statute of Anne.  Like most laws, it hasn't changed
	Xmuch since.  It was written with books and pictures in
	Xmind.  Parliament, lacking the foresight to predict the
	Xsuccess of the Intel and IBM corporations, failed to
	Xconsider the issue of copyrighting computer programs. 
	X.pg
	XAt first, courts questioned whether programs could be
	Xcopyrighted at all.  The problem was that judges
	Xcouldn't read the programs and they figured the
	XCopyright Law was only meant to apply to things humans
	X(which arguably includes judges) could read without the
	Xaid of a machine.  I saw some mythical discussion about
	Xthat in some of the net.legal drivel.  Let's lay that to
	Xrest:  programs are copyrightable as long as there is
	Xeven a minimal amount of creativity.  The issue was laid
	Xto rest with the Software Act of 1980.  That Act
	Xmodified the Copyright Act (which is a Federal law by
	Xthe way), in such a way as to make it clear that
	Xprograms are copyrightable.  The few exceptions to this
	Xrule will rarely concern anyone.  The next question to
	Xarise was whether a program was copyrightable if it was
	Xstored in ROM rather than on paper.   The decision in
	Xthe Apple v. Franklin case laid that to rest:  it is.
	X.hn 2
	XThe meaning of \f2copyright\fP
	X.pg
	XNow, what is copyright?  As it is commonly
	Xunderstood, it is the right to make copies of something
	X-- or to put it the other way around, it is the right to
	Xprohibit other people from making copies.  This is known
	Xas an exclusive right -- the exclusive right to
	X.i reproduce ,
	Xin the biological language of the Copyright
	XAct -- and what most people don't know is that copyright
	Xinvolves not one, not two, but five exclusive rights.   
	XThese are (1) the exclusive right to make copies, (2)
	Xthe exclusive right to distribute copies to the public,
	X(3) the exclusive right to prepare 
	X.i "derivative works"
	X(I'll explain, just keep reading), (4) the exclusive
	Xright to perform the work in public (this mainly applies
	Xto plays, dances and the like, but it could apply to
	Xsoftware), and (5) the exclusive right to display the
	Xwork in public (such as showing a film).
	X.hn 2
	XThe meaning of \f2public domain\fP
	X.pg
	XBefore we go any further, what is public
	Xdomain?  I saw some discussion on the net about public
	Xdomain software being copyrighted.  Nonsense.  The
	Xphrase 
	X.i "public domain,"
	Xwhen used correctly, means the
	Xabsence of copyright protection.  It means you can copy
	Xpublic domain software to your heart's content.  It
	Xmeans that the author has none of the exclusive rights
	Xlisted above.  If someone uses the phrase
	X.i "public domain"
	Xto refer to
	X.i freeware
	X(software which is copyrighted but is distributed without advance payment
	Xbut with a request for a donation), he or she is using
	Xthe term incorrectly.  Public domain means no copyright
	X-- no exclusive rights.
	X.hn 2
	XA hypothetical software purchase
	X.pg
	XLet's look at those exclusive rights from the
	Xviewpoint of someone who has legitimately purchased a
	Xsingle copy of a copyrighted computer program.  For the
	Xmoment, we'll have to ignore the fact that the program
	Xis supposedly licensed, because the license changes
	Xthings.  I'll explain that later.  For now, assume you
	Xwent to Fred's Diner and Software Mart and bought a
	Xdozen eggs, cat food and a word processing program.  And
	Xfor now, assume the program is copyrighted.
	X.hn 2
	XCan you use copyrighted software?
	X.pg
	XWhat can you do with this copyrighted
	Xsoftware?  Let's start with the obvious:  can you use it
	Xon your powerful Timex PC?  Is this a joke?  No.  Prior
	Xto 1980, my answer might have been No, you can't use it!
	X.pg
	XPeople actually pay me for advice like that!  Well
	Xthink:  you take the floppy disk out of the zip lock
	Xbaggy, insert it in drive A and load the program into
	XRAM.  What have you just done?  You've made a copy in
	XRAM -- in legalese, you've reproduced the work, in
	Xviolation of the copyright owner's exclusive right to
	Xreproduce.  (I better clarify something here:  the
	Xcopyright owner is the person or company whose name
	Xappears in the copyright notice on the box, or the disk
	Xor the first screen or wherever.  It may be the person
	Xwho wrote the program, or it may be his boss, or it may
	Xbe a publishing company that bought the rights to the
	Xprogram.  But in any case, it's not you. When you buy a
	Xcopy of the program, you do not become the copyright
	Xowner.  You just own one copy.)
	X.pg
	XAnyway, loading the program into RAM means
	Xmaking a copy.  The Software Act of 1980 addressed this
	Xabsurdity by allowing you to make a copy if the copy \*(lqis
	Xcreated as an essential step in the utilization of the
	Xcomputer program in conjunction with a machine and ...
	Xis used in no other manner ....\*(rq  By the way,
	Xsomebody tell me what 
	X.i "a machine"
	Xmeans.  If you connect
	X5 PC's on a network is that 
	X.i "a machine"
	Xor
	X.i "several machines" ?
	XA related question is whether or not running
	Xsoftware on a network constitutes a performance.  The
	Xcopyright owner has the exclusive right to do that,
	Xremember?
	X.hn 2
	XCan you make a backup copy?
	X.pg
	XOK, so you bought this copyrighted program
	Xand you loaded it into RAM or onto a hard disk without
	Xthe FBI knocking on your door.  Now can you make a
	Xbackup copy? 
	X.b YES .
	XThe Software Act also provided that
	Xyou can make a backup copy, provided that it \*(lqis for
	Xarchival purposes only ....\*(rq  What you cannot do,
	Xhowever, is give the archive copy to your friend so that
	Xyou and your pal both got the program for the price of
	Xone.  That violates the copyright owner's exclusive
	Xright to distribute copies to the public.  Get it?  You
	Xcan, on the other hand, give both your original and
	Xbackup to your friend -- or sell it to him, or lend it
	Xto him, as long as you don't retain a copy of the
	Xprogram you are selling.  Although the copyright owner
	Xhas the exclusive right to distribute (sell) copies of
	Xthe program, that right only applies to the first sale
	Xof any particular copy.  By analogy, if you buy a
	Xcopyrighted book, you are free to sell your book to a
	Xfriend.  The copyright owner does not have the right to
	Xcontrol resales.  
	X.hn 2
	XLicenses may change the rules
	X.pg
	XAt this point, let me remind you that we have
	Xassumed that the program you got at the store was sold
	Xto you, not licensed to you.  Licenses may change the
	Xrules.
	X.hn 2
	XCan you modify the program?
	X.pg
	XNow, you're a clever programmer, and you know
	Xthe program could run faster with some modifications. 
	XYou could also add graphics and an interactive mode and
	Xlots of other stuff.  What does copyright law say about
	Xyour plans?  Well ... several different things,
	Xactually.  First, recall that the copyright owner has
	Xthe exclusive right to make derivative works.  A
	Xderivative work is a work based on one or more
	Xpreexisting works.  It's easy to recognize derivative
	Xworks when you think about music or books.  If a book is
	Xcopyrighted, derivative works could include a
	Xscreenplay, an abridged edition, or a translation into
	Xanother language.  Derivative works of songs might be
	Xnew arrangements (like the jazz version of Love Potion
	XNumber 9), a movie soundtrack, or a written
	Xtranscription, or a 
	X.i "long version" ,
	X(such as the fifteen minute version of \*(lqWipe Out\*(rq with an extended
	Xdrum solo for dance parties).  In my opinion, you are making a
	Xderivative work when you take the store-bought word
	Xprocessor and modify it to perform differently.  The
	Xsame would be true if you 
	X.i translated
	Xa COBOL program
	Xinto BASIC.  Those are copyright infringements -- you've
	Xhorned in on the copyright owner's exclusive right to
	Xmake derivative works.  There is, however, some
	Xbreathing room.  The Software Act generously allows you
	Xto 
	X.i adapt
	Xthe code if the adaptation \*(lqis created as an
	Xessential step in the utilization of the computer
	Xprogram in conjunction with a machine ....\*(rq  For
	Xexample, you might have to modify the code to make it
	Xcompatible with your machine.
	X.hn 2
	XCan you break the copy protection scheme?
	X.pg
	XMoving right along, let's assume your store
	Xbought program is copy protected, and you'd really like
	Xto make a backup copy.  You know this nine-year-old whiz
	Xwho can crack any copy-protection scheme faster than you
	Xcan rearrange a Rubix cube.  Is there a copyright
	Xviolation if he succeeds?  There's room to argue here. 
	XWhen you try to figure out if something is an
	Xinfringement, ask yourself, what exclusive right am I
	Xviolating?  In this case, not the right to make copies,
	Xand not the right to distribute copies.  Public
	Xperformance and display have no relevance.  So the key
	Xquestion is whether you are making a 
	X.i "derivative work" .
	XMy answer to that question is, \*(lqI doubt it.\*(rq  On the
	Xother hand, I also doubt that breaking the protection
	Xscheme was \*(lqan essential step\*(rq in using the program in
	Xconjunction with a machine.  It might be a \*(lqfair use,\*(rq
	Xbut that will have to wait for another article.  Anyone
	Xinterested in stretching the limits of the \*(lqfair use\*(rq
	Xdefense should read the Sony 
	X.i Betamax
	Xcase.
	X.hn 2
	XSummary
	X.pg
	XLet me summarize. Copyright means the
	Xcopyright owner has the exclusive right to do certain
	Xthings. Copyright infringement means you did one of
	Xthose exclusive things (unless you did it within the
	Xlimits of the Software Act, i.e., as an essential step ....).

	XCopyright Sounds Neat -- How Do I Get One?  Or, How Do I Know if this Program is Copyrighted?
	X.hn 2
	XHow do you get a copyright?
	X.pg
	XIf you've written an original program, what do you have to do to get a
	Xcopyright? Nothing. You already have one.
	X.hn 2
	XHow do you lose a copyright?
	X.pg
	XIf you've written an original
	Xprogram, what do you have to do to lose your copyright
	Xprotection?  Give copies away without the copyright
	Xnotice.
	X.hn 2
	XHow do you waste a stamp?
	X.pg
	XIf you mail the program to yourself
	Xin a sealed envelope, what have you accomplished? 
	XYou've wasted a stamp and an envelope and burdened the
	Xpostal system unnecessarily.
	X.hn 2
	XDo you have to register?
	X.pg
	XDo you have to register your program
	Xwith the U.S. Copyright Office?  No, but it's a damn
	Xgood idea.
	X.hn 2
	XHow copyright comes into existence
	X.pg
	XCopyright protection (meaning the five
	Xexclusive rights) comes into existence the moment you
	X.i fix
	Xyour program in a 
	X.i "tangible medium" .
	XThat means
	Xwrite it down, or store it on a floppy disk, or do
	Xsomething similar.  Registration is optional.  The one
	Xthing you must do, however, is protect your copyright by
	Xincluding a copyright notice on every copy of every
	Xprogram you sell, give away, lend out, etc.  If you
	Xdon't, someone who happens across your program with no
	Xnotice on it can safely assume that it is in the public
	Xdomain (unless he actually knows that it is not).  
	X.hn 2
	XThe copyright notice
	X.pg
	XThe copyright notice has three parts.  The
	Xfirst can be either a c with a circle around it (\(co), or the
	Xword 
	X.b Copyright
	Xor the abbreviation 
	X.b Copr.
	XThe c
	Xwith a circle around it is preferable, because it is
	Xrecognized around the world; the others are not.  That's
	Xincredibly important.  Countries around the world have
	Xagreed to recognize and uphold each others' copyrights,
	Xbut this world-wide protection requires the use of the c
	Xin a circle.  On disk labels and program packaging, use
	Xthe encircled c.  Unfortunately, computers don't draw
	Xsmall circles well, so programmers have resorted to a c
	Xin parentheses: (c).  Too bad.  That has no legal
	Xmeaning.  When you put your notice in the code and on
	Xthe screen, use 
	X.b Copyright
	Xor 
	X.b Copr.
	Xif you can't make a circle.
	X.pg
	XThe second part of the notice is the \*(lqyear
	Xof first publication of the work.\*(rq  
	X.i Publication
	Xdoesn't mean distribution by Osborne Publishing Co.  It
	Xmeans distribution of copies of the program to the
	Xpublic \*(lqby sale or other transfer of ownership, or by
	Xrental, lease, or lending.\*(rq  So when you start handing
	Xout or selling copies of your precious code, you are
	Xpublishing.  Publication also takes place when you
	Xmerely OFFER to distribute copies to a group for further
	Xdistribution.  Your notice must include the year that
	Xyou first did so.
	X.pg
	XThe third part of the notice is the name of
	Xthe owner of the copyright.  Hopefully, that's you, in
	Xwhich case your last name will do.  If your company owns
	Xthe program -- a legal issue which I will address later
	Xin this article -- the company name is appropriate.
	X.pg
	XWhere do you put the notice?  The general
	Xidea is to put it where people are likely to see it. 
	XSpecifically, if you're distributing a human-readable
	Xcode listing, put it on the first page in the first few
	Xlines of code, and hard code it so that it appears on
	Xthe title screen, or at sign-off, or continuously.  If
	Xyou're distributing machine-readable versions only, hard
	Xcode it.  As an extra precaution, you should also place
	Xthe notice on the gummed disk label or in some other
	Xfashion permanently attached to the storage medium.
	X.hn 2
	XAdvantages of registration
	X.pg
	XNow, why register the program?  If no one
	Xever rips off your program, you won't care much about
	Xregistration.  If someone does rip it off, you'll kick
	Xyourself for not having registered it.  The reason is
	Xthat if the program is registered before the
	Xinfringement takes place, you can recover some big bucks
	Xfrom the infringer, called statutory damages, and the
	Xcourt can order the infringer to pay your attorneys
	Xfees.  Registration only costs $10.00, and it's easy to
	Xdo yourself.  The only potential disadvantage is the
	Xrequirement that you deposit the first and last 25 pages
	Xof your source code, which can be inspected (but not
	Xcopied) by members of the public.

	X.hn 1
	XWho Owns The Program You Wrote?
	X.hn 2
	XIntroduction
	X.pg
	XThe starting point of this analysis is that if you wrote
	Xthe program, you are the author, and copyright belongs
	Xto the author.  HOWEVER, that can change instantly. 
	XThere are two common ways for your ownership to shift to
	Xsomeone else:  first, your program might be a \*(lqwork for
	Xhire.\*(rq  Second, you might sell or assign your 
	X.i rights
	Xin the program, which for our purposes means the
	Xcopyright.  
	X.hn 2
	XPrograms written as an employee
	X.pg
	XMost of the programs which you write at
	Xwork, if not all of them, belong to your employer. 
	XThat's because a program prepared by an employee within
	Xthe scope of his or her employment is a \*(lqwork for hire,\*(rq
	Xand the employer is considered the 
	X.i author .
	XThis is more or less automatic if you are an employee -- no
	Xwritten agreement is necessary to make your employer the
	Xcopyright owner.  By contrast, if you can convince your
	Xemployer to let you be the copyright owner, you must
	Xhave that agreement in writing.
	X.pg
	XBy the way, before you give up hope of
	Xowning the copyright to the program you wrote at work,
	Xfigure out if you are really an employee.  That is
	Xactually a complex legal question, but I can tell you
	Xnow that just because your boss says you are an employee
	Xdoesn't mean that it's so.  And remember that if you
	Xcreated the program outside the 
	X.i scope
	Xof your job, the
	Xprogram is not a \*(lqwork for hire.\*(rq  Finally, in
	XCalifornia and probably elsewhere, the state labor law
	Xprovides that employees own products they create on
	Xtheir own time, using their own tools and materials. 
	XEmployment contracts which attempt to make the employer
	Xthe owner of those off-the-job 
	X.i inventions
	Xare void, at least in sunny California.
	X.hn 2
	XPrograms written as a contractor
	X.pg
	XWait a minute:  I'm an independent
	Xcontractor to Company X, not an employee.  I come and go
	Xas I please, get paid by the hour with no tax withheld,
	Xand was retained to complete a specific project.  I
	Xfrequently work at home with my own equipment.  Is the
	Xprogram I'm writing a \*(lqwork for hire,\*(rq owned by the
	XCompany?  Maybe, maybe not.  In California, this area is
	Xfull of landmines for employers, and gold for
	Xcontractors.
	X.pg
	XA contractor's program is not a \*(lqwork for
	Xhire,\*(rq and is not owned by the company, unless (1) there
	Xis a written agreement between the company and the
	Xcontractor which says that it is, and (2) the work is a
	X.i "commissioned work" .
	XA
	X.i "commissioned work"
	Xis one of
	Xthe following:  (a)  a contribution to a 
	X.i "collective work" ,
	X(b) an audiovisual work (like a movie, and maybe like a video game),
	X(c) a translation, (d) a compilation, (e) an instructional text,
	X(f) a test or answer to a test, or (g) an atlas.  I know you must be
	Xtired of definitions, but this is what the real legal
	Xworld is made of.  An example of a  collective work is a
	Xbook of poetry, with poems contributed by various
	Xauthors.  A piece of code which is incorporated into a
	Xlarge program isn't a contribution to a collective work,
	Xbut a stand-alone program which is packaged and sold
	Xwith other stand-alone programs could be.   
	X.pg
	XSo where are we?  If you are a contract
	Xprogrammer, not an employee, and your program is a
	X.i "commissioned work" ,
	Xand you have a written agreement
	Xthat says that the program is a \*(lqwork for hire\*(rq owned by
	Xthe greedy company, who owns the program?  That's right,
	Xthe company.  But guess what?  In California and
	Xelsewhere the company just became your employer!  This
	Xmeans that the company must now provide worker's
	Xcompensation benefits for you
	X.b "AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE" .

	XWhen you get software at the local five and dime, the
	Xmanufacturer claims that you have a license to use that
	Xcopy of the program.  The reason for this is that the
	Xmanufacturer wants to place more restrictions on your
	Xuse of the program than copyright law places.  For
	Xexample, licenses typically say you can only use the
	Xprogram on a single designated CPU.  Nothing in the
	Xcopyright law says that.  Some licenses say you cannot
	Xmake an archive copy.  The copyright law says you can,
	Xremember?  But if the license is a valid license, now
	Xyou can't.  You can sell or give away your copy of a
	Xprogram if you purchased it, right?  That's permitted by
	Xcopyright law, but the license may prohibit it.  The
	Xmore restrictive terms of the license will apply instead
	Xof the more liberal copyright rules.
	X.hn 2
	XIs it valid?
	X.pg
	XIs the license valid?  This is hotly debated
	Xamong lawyers.  (What isn't?  We'll argue about the time
	Xof day.)  A few states have passed or will soon pass
	Xlaws declaring that they are valid.  A few will go the
	Xother way.  Federal legislation is unlikely.  My
	Xargument is that at the consumer level, the license is
	Xnot binding because there is no true negotiation (unless
	Xa state law says it is binding), but hey that's just an
	Xargument and I'm not saying that that's the law.  In any
	Xcase, I think businesses which buy software will be
	Xtreated differently in court than consumers.  Businesses
	Xshould read those licenses and negotiate with the
	Xmanufacturer if the terms are unacceptable.  
	X.hn 1
	XI Have A Neat Idea. Can I Trademark It?  What About patent?
	X.hn 2
	XTrademark law explained
	X.pg
	XSorry, no luck.  Trademark law protects names:  names of
	Xproducts and names of services.  (Note that I did not
	Xsay names of companies.  Company names are not
	Xtrademarkable.)  If you buy a program that has a
	Xtrademarked name, all that means is that you can't sell
	Xyour own similar program under the same name.  It has
	Xnothing to do with copying the program.  
	X.hn 2
	XPatent Law
	X.pg
	XPatent law can apply to computer programs,
	Xbut it seldom does.  The main reasons it seldom applies
	Xare practical:  the patent process is too slow and too
	Xexpensive to do much good in the software world.  There
	Xare also considerable legal hurdles to overcome in order
	Xto obtain a patent.  If, by chance, a program is
	Xpatented, the patent owner has the exclusive right to
	Xmake, use or sell it for 17 years.

	XCONCLUSION
	X.pg
	XI know this is a long article,
	Xbut believe it or not I just scratched the surface. 
	XHopefully, you'll find this information useful, and
	Xyou'll stop passing along myths about copyright law.  If
	Xanyone needs more information, I can be reached at the
	Xaddress on the first page.
	XSorry, but I do not usually have
	Xaccess to the network, so you can't reach me there.

	XThank you.  JORDAN J. BRESLOW

	XWhat is the Network News?
	X.pg
	XUSENET (Users' Network)
	Xis a bulletin board shared among many
	Xcomputer systems around the world.
	XUSENET is a logical network,
	Xsitting on top of several physical networks,
	Xincluding
	X.i UUCP ,
	X.i BLICN ,
	X.i BERKNET ,
	X.i X.25 ,
	Xand the
	X.i ARPANET .
	XSites on USENET include many universities,
	Xprivate companies, and research organizations.
	XMost of the members of USENET are either
	Xuniversity computer science departments
	Xor part of AT&T.
	XCurrently, there are over 50,000 participants at over 2,000 USENET sites in
	Xthe USA, Canada, Europe, Japan and Korea with more joining every day.
	XMost are running the
	X.ux
	Xoperating system.
	X.pg
	XThe network news,
	Xor simply
	X.i netnews ,
	Xis the set of programs that provide access to the news
	Xand transfer it from one machine to the next.
	XNetnews was originally written at Duke University
	Xand has been modified extensively by the University
	Xof California at Berkeley and others.
	XNetnews allows articles to be posted for limited or very wide distribution.
	XThis document contains a list of newsgroups
	Xthat were active at the time the document was written.
	XIt exists
	Xto assist you in determining which newsgroups you may
	Xwant to subscribe to.
	XWhen creating a new article,
	Xthe level of distribution can be controlled
	Xby use of the
	X.cf Distribution
	Xfield.
	XThis will prevent notices of apartments for rent in New Jersey
	Xbeing broadcast to California
	X(or even Europe).
	X.pg
	XAny user can post an article,
	Xwhich will be sent out to the network
	Xto be read by persons interested in that topic.
	XYou can specify which topics are of interest to you by putting them in a
	X.i "subscription list" .
	XThen,
	Xwhenever you ask to read news,
	Xthe news reading program will present all unread articles of interest.
	XThere are also facilities for browsing through old news,
	Xposting follow-up articles,
	Xand sending direct electronic mail replies to the author of an article.
	X.pg
	XThis paper is a tutorial,
	Xaimed at the user who wants to read and possibly post news.
	XThe system administrator who must install the software
	Xshould see the companion document
	X.i "USENET Version B Installation" .
	X.hu
	XWhy USENET?
	X.pg
	XUSENET is useful in a number of ways.
	XSomeone wishing to announce a new program or product can reach a wide audience.
	XA user can ask \*(lqDoes anyone have an
	X.i x ?\*(rq
	Xand will usually get several responses within a day or two.
	XBug reports and their fixes can be made quickly available
	Xwithout the usual overhead of sending out mass mailings.
	XDiscussions involving many people at different locations
	Xcan take place without having to get everyone together.
	X.pg
	XAnother facility with similar capabilities to
	X.i netnews
	Xis the
	X.i "electronic mailing list" .
	XA mailing list is a collection of electronic mailing addresses of users
	Xwho are interested in a particular topic.
	XBy sending electronic mail to the list,
	Xall users on the list receive a copy of the article.
	XWhile the mailing list facility is quite useful,
	XUSENET offers a number of advantages not present in mailing lists.
	XGetting yourself on a mailing list is not always easy.
	XYou have to figure out who maintains the list and ask them to put you on it.
	XOften these people are out of town or busy,
	Xand don't put you on the list for several days.
	XSometimes you have to send mail to the entire mailing list,
	Xhoping that one of the readers will tell you who maintains the list.
	XOnce you are on the list,
	Xyou often find yourself in the middle of a discussion.
	XNetnews keeps old articles around until they expire (usually about two weeks)
	Xso you can browse through old news to catch up on what you missed.
	XSimilarly,
	Xreferring to an old article is easy,
	Xwithout having to keep a personal file of all old mail to the list.
	X.pg
	XAnother advantage is appreciated by the other users of the system.
	XThere is less overhead in having only one copy of each message
	Xsent to each machine,
	Xrather than having separate copies sent
	Xto each of several users on the same machine.
	XThis cuts down on computer time to process the messages,
	Xand on-line costs for telephone calls to transfer messages
	Xfrom one machine to another (when phone lines are used).
	XAnother advantage is in the disk space consumed.
	XWhen only one message is sent to each system,
	Xonly one copy of the message is kept on disk.
	XIn a mailing list environment,
	Xeach user has a copy in a mailbox.
	XOf course, if the mailing list is small enough the overhead is less
	Xthan an international newsgroup.
	X.hu
	XHow do I Read News?
	X.pg
	XIn the USENET jargon,
	Xinterest topics are called
	X.i newsgroups .
	XA newsgroup list appears in a later section,
	Xcurrent as this paper was written.
	XYou have your own
	X.i "subscription list"
	Xof newsgroups to which you are said to
	X.i subscribe .
	X.pg
	XThe simplest way to read news is to type the command:
	X.sd c
	Xreadnews
	X.ed
	XOther possibilities include: a full-screen-oriented news reading program,
	X.i vnews (1),
	X(described in the Appendix,) the
	X.i notesfile
	Xsystem, which can also be used for news (described in a separate paper,)
	Xand
	X.i rn ,
	Xa very popular news reading program distributed separately from this package.
	XEach newsgroup to which you subscribe will be presented,
	Xone article at a time.
	XAs each article is presented,
	Xyou will be shown the
	X.i header
	X(containing the name of the author,
	Xthe subject,
	Xand the length of the article)
	Xand you will be asked if you want more.
	XThere are a number of possible choices you can make at this point.
	XThe three most common
	X.qp y , (
	X.qp n ,
	Xand
	X.qp q )
	Xare suggested by the program.
	X(To see a complete list of possible responses,
	Xtype
	X.qp ?
	Xfor help.)
	XYou can type
	X.qp y
	Xfor \*(lqyes\*(rq
	X(or simply hit
	X.qc RETURN )
	Xand the rest of the message will be displayed.
	X(If the message is long,
	Xit may stop before it runs off the top of the screen.
	XType
	X.qc SPACE
	Xor
	X.qc RETURN
	Xto see more of the message.
	XAnother choice you can make is
	X.qp n
	Xfor \*(lqno\*(rq.
	XThis means you are not interested in the message \-
	Xit will not be offered to you again.
	XA third option is
	X.qp q
	Xfor \*(lqquit\*(rq.
	XThis causes a record to be made of which articles you read
	X(or refused)
	Xand you will exit netnews.
	XWhen you have read all the news,
	Xthis happens automatically.
	XThe
	X.qp q
	Xcommand is mainly useful if you are in a hurry
	Xand don't have time to read all the news right now.
	X(Many users put a
	X.i readnews (1)
	Xor
	X.i checknews (1)
	Xcommand in their
	X.i .profile
	Xor
	X.i .login
	Xfiles so that they will see new news each time they log in.)
	X.pg
	XIf you are reading news for the first time,
	Xyou may find yourself swamped by the volume of unread news,
	Xespecially if the default subscription is
	X.ng all .
	XDon't let this bother you.
	XIf you are getting newsgroups in which you have no interest,
	Xyou can change your subscription list
	X(see below).
	XAlso,
	Xbear in mind that what you see
	Xis probably at least two weeks' accumulation of news.
	XIf you want to just get rid of all old news and start anew,
	Xtype
	X.sd c
	Xreadnews \-K \-n all
	X.ed
	Xwhich will throw away all old news,
	Xrecording that you have seen it all.
	XOr,
	Xyou can use the
	X.qp K
	Xcommand to mark all articles in the current newsgroup as read.
	X.pg
	XOnce you catch up with (or ignore) all the old news,
	Xthe news will come in daily at a more manageable rate.
	X(If the daily rate is still too much
	Xyou may wish to unsubscribe to some of the higher volume, less useful newsgroups.)
	XFinally,
	Xnote that while an article is printing,
	Xyou can hit
	Xyour interrupt character
	X(usually
	X.qc CONTROL-C
	Xor
	X.qc DELETE ),
	Xwhich will throw away the rest of the article.
	X.pg
	XAmong the other commands you can type after seeing the header
	Xof an article are:
	X.Qp x 13
	XExit
	X.i readnews .
	XThis is different from
	X.qp q
	Xin that the
	X.qp q
	Xcommand
	Xwill update the record of which articles you have read,
	Xbut
	X.qp x
	Xwill pretend you never started
	X.i readnews .
	X.Qp N 13
	XGo on to the next newsgroup.
	XThe remaining articles in the current newsgroup are considered
	X.i unread ,
	Xand will be offered to you again the next time you read news.
	X.Qp "s \f2file\fP" 13
	XThe article is saved in a disk file with the given name.
	XIn practice,
	Xwhat usually happens is that an article is printed,
	Xand then
	X.i readnews
	Xgoes on to print the header of the next article
	Xbefore you get a chance to type anything.
	XSo you usually want to write out the
	X.i previous
	Xmessage
	X(the last one you have read in full);
	Xin this case,
	Xuse the form
	X.qp s\-
	X.i filename .
	X.Qp e 13
	XErase the memory of having seen this article.
	XIt will be offered to you again next time,
	Xas though you had never seen it.
	XThe variation
	X.qp e\-
	X(erase  memory of the previously read article instead of
	Xthe current article) is useful for checking follow-ups to see
	Xif anyone has already said what you wanted to say.
	X.Qp r 13
	XReply to the author of the message.
	XYou will be placed in the editor,
	Xwith a set of headers derived from the message you are replying to.
	XType in your message after the blank line.
	XIf you wish to edit the header list
	Xto add more recipients or send carbon copies,
	Xfor instance,
	Xyou can edit the header lines.
	XAnyone listed on a line beginning with
	X.hf To
	Xor
	X.hf Cc
	Xwill receive a copy of your reply.
	XNote that the path used to receive a piece of news may not be the fastest
	Xway to reply by mail. If speed is important and you know a faster way,
	Xedit it in place of what the reply command supplied.
	XA mail command will then be started up,
	Xaddressed to the persons listed in the header.
	XYou are then returned to
	X.i readnews .
	XThe case
	X.qp r\-
	Xis also useful to reply to the previous message.
	XAnother variation on this is
	X.qp rd\-
	Xwhich puts you in
	X.b $MAILER
	X(or
	X.i mail (1)
	Xby default)
	Xto type in your reply directly.
	X.Qp f 13
	XPost a follow-up message to the same newsgroup.
	XThis posts an article on this newsgroup
	Xwith the same title as the original article.
	XUse common sense when posting follow-ups. (Read Matt Bishop's paper
	X\*(lqHow to use USENET Effectively\*(rq for extended discussion of when
	Xand when not to post -- many follow-up articles should have just been replies.)
	XYou will be placed in the editor. Enter your message and exit.
	XThe case
	X.qp f\-
	Xis also useful to follow up the previous message.
	XIn each case,
	Xthe editor you are placed in will be
	X.i vi (1)
	Xunless you set
	X.b EDITOR
	X(in your environment) to some other editor.
	XYou should enter the text of the follow-up after the blank line.
	X.Qp + 13
	XThe article is skipped for now.
	XThe next time you read news,
	Xyou will be offered this article again.
	X.Qp \- 13
	XGo back to the previous article.
	XThis toggles,
	Xso that two
	X.qp \- 's
	Xget you the current article.
	X.Qp b 13
	XBack up one article in the current group.
	XThis is not necessarily the previous article.
	X.Qp U 13
	XUnsubscribe from this newsgroup.
	XYour
	X.i \&.newsrc (5)
	Xfile will be edited to change the
	X.qp :
	Xfor that newsgroup to an
	X.qp !
	Xpreventing you from being shown that newsgroup again.
	X.Qp ? 13
	XIf you type any unrecognized command,
	Xa summary of valid commands will be printed.
	X.hu
	XChanging your Subscription List
	X.pg
	XIf you take no special action you will subscribe to a default subscription list.
	XThis default varies locally.
	XTo find out your local default,
	Xtype
	X.sd c
	Xreadnews \-s
	X.ed
	XTypically this list will include all newsgroups ending in \*(lqgeneral\*(rq
	Xor \*(lqannounce\*(rq,
	Xsuch as
	X.ng general ,
	Xand
	X.ng news.announce .
	X(As distributed,
	Xthe default is
	X.ng general\f1,\fPall.announce .
	XAnother popular default is
	X.ng all .)
	XYou can change this by creating a file in your home directory named
	X.i .newsrc
	Xwhich contains as its first line a line of the form:
	X.sd c
	Xoptions \-n newsgroup,newsgroup,newsgroup ...
	X.ed
	XIf your lines get too long,
	Xyou can continue them on subsequent lines
	Xby beginning those lines with a space.
	X(The netnews system will put extra lines in this file
	Xto record which articles you have read.
	XYou should ignore these lines unless you want to edit them.)
	XFor example,
	Xif you are creating a subscription list for the first time,
	Xand have already read news,
	Xyou will find some text already in your
	X.i .newsrc
	Xfile,
	Xrecording which articles you have read.
	XYou should put your
	X.b options
	Xline before the first line of the file.)
	XThus,
	X.sd c
	Xoptions \-n general,news.announce,comp.human-nets
	X.ed
	Xwill subscribe to those three newsgroups.
	X.pg
	XAn
	X.qp !
	Xcan be used to exclude certain newsgroups and the word
	X.ng all
	Xcan be used as a wild card,
	Xrepresenting any newsgroup.
	XYou can also use
	X.ng all
	Xas a prefix or suffix to match a class of newsgroups.
	XFor example,
	X.sd c
	Xoptions \-n all,!talk,!rec.humor,!all.unix
	X.ed
	Xwill result in a subscription to all newsgroups except for \*(lqtalk\*(rq group,
	Xjokes,
	Xand any
	X.ux
	Xinformation.
	XThe metacharacter
	X.qp .
	Xis like
	X.qp /
	Xto the shell,
	Xand
	X.ng all
	Xis like
	X.qp * .
	X.pg
	XA simpler way to subscribe to news is to subscribe to
	X.ng all ,
	Xand then use the
	X.qp U
	X.i readnews
	Xcommand to unsubscribe to newsgroups you don't want to read.
	XThis way you will see new newsgroups that are created,
	Xget a chance to evaluate them,
	Xand then unsubscribe to those that don't interest you.
	X.pg
	XThe order of the newsgroups in your
	X.i .newsrc
	X(after the options line)
	Xis the order in which newsgroups will be shown.
	XIf you want something other than the default,
	Xmove the lines around until you are satisfied with the order.
	XBe careful to keep the options line as the first line in the file.
	X.hu
	XSubmitting Articles
	X.pg
	XTo submit a new news article type
	X.sd c
	Xpostnews
	X.ed
	XFirst,
	Xit will ask you if this is a follow-up to an article.
	XAnswer
	X.b yes
	Xor
	X.b no .
	XIf
	X.b yes ,
	Xyou really should have done an
	X.qp f
	Xfrom
	X.i readnews ,
	Xbut it will try and figure out which article you are following up to.
	XIt will ask for the newsgroup in which you read the article
	Xand the article number.
	XIf you can't remember,
	Xgo back to
	X.i readnews
	Xand find out.
	XIt is important that discussions are kept together.
	XIt is very frustrating for someone to read a follow-up that says:
	X\&\*(lqI agree.
	XIt's very dangerous to leave that program as distributed.\*(rq
	Xand not have any idea what the poster was referring to.
	X.pg
	XIf you answer
	X.b no ,
	X.i postnews (1)
	Xwill ask you for the subject of the new article.
	XThis should be as informative as possible.
	XFor example,
	X.cf "'67 Porsche for sale in New Jersey"
	Xis much better than
	X.cf "Car for sale"
	Xor even
	X.cf "For sale" .
	XIt will then ask which newsgroups you want the article posted in.
	XIf you are unsure,
	Xtype
	X.qp ?
	Xinstead of a specific newsgroup
	Xand it will show you the list of currently available groups.
	XThen,
	Xyou will be asked how far your article should be distributed.
	XIt is important to keep this as small as possible
	Xto accomplish the purpose of your article.
	XRemember that many newsgroups are read in Europe,
	XAustralia,
	Xand Asia in addition to the United States and Canada.
	XIt does no good
	X(to use the previous example)
	Xto post a
	X.cf "Car for sale in New Jersey"
	Xarticle with a distribution of 
	X.ng world .
	XThere is almost no chance that a person in Sweden or Korea
	Xwould be interested in buying your car (even if it is a Porsche).
	XIt is a waste of money and computer resources
	Xto transmit the article that far.
	XFor this specific case,
	Xthe appropriate distribution would be
	X.ng nj
	Xor only in New Jersey.
	XIf there were no local distribution available,
	Xat least it should be confined to
	X.ng usa .
	XIf you are unsure of the distributions available at your site,
	Xtype
	X.qp ?
	Xinstead of a distribution
	Xand you will receive a list of distributions valid for your site.
	XIf the distribution is
	X.ng world ,
	Xyour article will be read (perhaps with disgust)
	Xby thousands of people around the world.
	X.pg
	XThen you will be placed in the editor.
	XEnter the text of your article,
	Xafter the blank line,
	Xand exit the editor.
	XThe article will be posted to the newsgroups specified.
	XIf you change your mind about the headers while you are still in the editor,
	Xyou can edit them as well.
	XExtra headers can also be added before the blank line.
	X.hu
	XBrowsing through Old News
	X.pg
	XThere are a number of command line options to the
	X.i readnews
	Xcommand to help you find an old article you want to see again.
	XThe
	X.op \-n
	X.i newsgroups
	Xoption restricts your search to certain newsgroups.
	XThe
	X.op \-x
	Xoption arranges to ignore the record of articles read,
	Xwhich is kept in your
	X.i \&.newsrc
	Xfile.
	XThis will cause all articles in all newsgroups to which you
	Xsubscribe to be displayed,
	Xeven those which you have already seen.
	XIt also causes
	X.i readnews
	Xto not update the
	X.i \&.newsrc
	Xfile.
	XThe
	X.op \-a
	X.i date
	Xoption asks for news received after the given
	X.i date .
	XNote that even with the
	X.op \-a
	Xoption, only articles you have not already seen will be printed,
	Xunless you combine it with the
	X.op \-x
	Xoption.
	X(Articles are kept on file until they expire,
	Xtypically after two weeks.)
	XThe
	X.op \-t
	X.i keywords
	Xoption restricts the query to articles mentioning one of the
	X.i keywords
	Xin the title of the article.
	XThus,
	Xthe command
	X.sd c
	Xreadnews \-n comp.unix \-x \-a last thursday \-t setuid
	X.ed
	Xasks for all articles in newsgroup
	X.ng comp.unix
	Xsince last Thursday about the setuid feature.
	X(Be careful with the
	X.op \-t
	Xoption.
	XThe above example will not find articles about
	X.cf suid ,
	Xnor will it find articles with no title or
	Xwhose author did not use the word
	X.cf setuid
	Xin the title.)
	X.pg
	XOther useful options include the
	X.op \-l
	Xoption (which lists only the headers of articles \-
	Xa useful form for browsing through lots of messages.)
	XThe
	X.op \-p
	Xoption prints the messages without asking for any input;
	Xthis is similar to some older news programs on many
	X.ux
	Xsystems and is useful for directing output to a printer.
	XThe
	X.op \-r
	Xoption produces articles in reverse order,
	Xfrom newest to oldest.
	X.hu
	XUser Interfaces
	X.pg
	XThe
	X.i "user interface"
	Xof a program is the view it presents to the user,
	Xthat is,
	Xwhat it prints and what it allows you to type.
	X.i Readnews
	Xhas options allowing you to use different user interfaces.
	XThe interface described above is called the \*(lqmsgs\*(rq interface
	Xbecause it mimics the style of the Berkeley
	X.i msgs (1)
	Xprogram.
	X(This program,
	Xin turn,
	Xmimics a program at MIT of the same name.)
	XThe key element of the msgs interface is that after printing the header,
	Xyou are asked if you want the rest of the message.
	X.pg
	XAnother interface is available with the
	X.op \-c
	Xoption.
	XIn this case,
	Xthe entire message is printed,
	Xheader and body,
	Xand you are prompted at the end of the message.
	XThe command options are the same as the msgs interface,
	Xbut it is usually not necessary to use the
	X.qp \-
	Xsuffix on the
	X.qp r ,
	X.qp s ,
	Xor
	X.qp f
	Xcommands.
	XThis interface is called the \*(lq/bin/mail\*(rq
	X(pronounced \*(lqbin mail\*(lq)
	Xinterface,
	Xbecause it mimics the
	X.ux
	Xprogram of that name.
	X.pg
	XA third interface is the
	X.i Mail (1)
	X(pronounced \*(lqcap mail\*(rq) interface,
	Xavailable with the
	X.op \-M
	Xoption.
	XThis invokes the
	X.i Mail
	Xprogram directly,
	Xand allows you to read news with the same commands as you read mail.
	X(This interface may not work on your system \-
	Xit requires a special version of
	X.i Mail
	Xwith a
	X.qp \-T
	Xoption.)
	X.pg
	XA fourth interface, is the MH news/mail program from Rand.
	XThat program can be used directly to read network news.
	X.pg
	XA fifth interface,
	X.i vnews ,
	Xwhich works well on display terminals, is described in the Appendix.
	X.pg
	XA sixth possibility is the 
	X.i notesfile
	Xsystem, described in a separate paper.  It is also display-oriented.
	X.pg
	XA seventh interface is
	X.i rn .
	XIt is quite powerful and reminiscent of the EMACS text editor.
	X.pg
	XAn eighth possibility is to use your favorite mail system as an interface.
	XThere are a number of different mail reading programs, including
	X.i /bin/mail (1),
	X.i Mail ,
	X.i msg (1),
	Xand MH.
	XAny mail system with an option to specify an alternative mailbox
	Xcan be used to read news.
	XFor example,
	Xto use
	X.i Mail
	Xwithout the
	X.qp \-M
	Xoption,
	Xtype
	X.sd c
	Xreadnews \-c "Mail \-f %"
	X.ed
	XThe shell command in quotes is invoked as a child of
	X.i readnews.
	XThe
	X.qp \-f
	Xoption to
	X.i Mail
	Xnames the alternative mailbox.
	X.i Readnews
	Xwill put the news in a temporary file,
	Xand give the name of this file to the mailer in place of the
	X.qp % .
	XThere is an important difference when using this kind of interface.
	XThe mailers do not give any indication of which articles you read
	Xand which ones you skipped.
	X.i Readnews
	Xwill assume you read
	X.i all
	Xthe articles,
	Xeven if you didn't,
	Xand mark them all read.
	XBy contrast,
	Xthe
	X.op \-M
	Xoption uses the
	X.op \-T
	Xoption to
	X.i Mail ,
	Xasking
	X.i Mail
	Xto tell
	X.i readnews
	Xwhich articles you read.
	X.hu
	XGetting News when you Log In
	X.pg
	XMost users like to be told when they first log in if there is any news.
	XThis way they are reminded of news,
	Xbut are not interrupted by it during the day.
	XIf you log in once in the morning,
	Xyou can think of getting the news as reading the morning newspaper.
	XIt is common to put a
	X.i checknews
	Xor
	X.i readnews
	Xcommand in your
	X.i .profile
	Xor
	X.i .login
	Xfile of commands that are executed when you log in.
	X.pg
	XSince there might not be any news,
	Xand since the
	X.i readnews
	Xcommand goes to a considerable amount of work to find all unread news
	X(assuming you are going to read it),
	Xthere is another command,
	Xcalled
	X.i checknews ,
	Xwhich tells you if there is any news.
	XThe
	X.i checknews
	Xcommand is smaller and faster than
	X.i readnews ,
	Xand was designed especially for a login file.
	XThere are also options to be silent if there is (or is not) news,
	Xand to start up
	X.i readnews
	Xautomatically if there is news.
	X.pg
	XThe options to
	X.i checknews
	Xare:
	X.Op \-y 10
	XPrint \*(lqThere is news\*(rq if there is any unread news.
	X.Op \-v 10
	XIf
	X.op \-y
	Xis also given,
	Xinstead of printing \*(lqThere is news\*(rq,
	Xprints \*(lqNews: \fInewsgroup\fP ...\*(rq
	Xgiving the name of the first newsgroup containing unread news.
	XIf
	X.ng general
	Xis the first newsgroup presented,
	Xthis can be used to tell users whether the unread news is important.
	X.Op \-n 10
	XPrint \*(lqNo news\*(rq if there is no unread news.
	X.Op \-e 10
	XIf there is any unread news,
	Xstart up
	X.i readnews.
	XAny additional arguments after the
	X.op \-e
	Xwill be passed to readnews.
	X.pg
	XThus,
	X.sd c
	Xchecknews \-yn
	X.ed
	Xtells you whether there is any unread news.
	X.sd c
	Xchecknews \-e \-M
	X.ed
	Xstarts up
	X.i readnews
	Xwith the
	X.i Mail
	Xinterface if there is news,
	Xand otherwise does nothing.
	X.sd c
	Xchecknews \-y
	X.ed
	Xtells you if there is news,
	Xand is silent if there is no news.
	X.hu
	XCreating New Newsgroups
	X.pg
	XNew newsgroups are proposed by the users and created by site administrators.
	XTo create a newsgroup,
	Xfirst make sure this is the right thing to do.
	XNormally a suggestion is first posted to
	X.ng news.groups\f1,\fPwhatever.relatedgroup
	Xfor a world wide newsgroup
	X.ng whatever.relatedgroup "" (
	Xshould be the group which you are proposing to subdivide.)
	XFor example,
	Xto propose creating
	X.ng rec.arts.tv.soaps ,
	Xpost the original article to
	X.ng rec.arts.tv\f1,\fPnews.groups ).
	XFollowups are made to
	X.ng news.groups
	X.i only .
	X(You can force this by putting the line:
	X.sd c
	XFollowup-To: news.groups
	X.ed
	Xin the headers of your original posting).
	XIf it is established that there is general interest in such a group,
	Xand a name is agreed on,
	Xthen ask your local netnews administrator to create the newsgroup.
	X(It can actually be created by any netnews administrator anywhere on the net,
	Xwithin the scope of the newsgroup.)
	XOnce the newsgroup is created and the first article has been posted,
	Xthe newsgroup is available for all interested persons to post to.
	X.hu
	XList of Newsgroups
	X.pg
	XThis section lists the newsgroups that are currently active.
	XIt is intended to help you decide what you want to subscribe to.
	XNote that the list is constantly changing.
	XNote also that this list only describes those groups available
	Xon a network-wide basis. Since not all installations choose to receive all
	Xnewsgroups, it is recommended that each installation edit the list of local
	Xnewsgroups to be correct before distributing this document to their users.
	XIf this is not possible,
	Xa local appendix can be created.
	X.hu 2
	XLocal
	X.pg
	XLocal groups are kept on the current machine only.
	XLocal names can be identified by the lack of a prefix,
	Xthat is, there are no periods in local newsgroup names.
	X.lp general 10
	XNews to be read by everyone on the local machine.
	XFor example:
	X\&\*(lqThe system will be down Monday morning for PM.\*(rq
	XOr,
	X\&\*(lqA new version of program
	X.i x
	Xhas been installed.\*(rq
	XThis newsgroup is usually mandatory \-
	Xyou are required to subscribe to this newsgroup.
	X(The list of mandatory newsgroups varies locally.)
	XThis requirement assures that important announcements reach all users.

	XAppendix \- How to use vnews
	X.hu 2 
	XOverview
	X.pg
	X.i Vnews
	Xis a program for reading USENET news.
	XIt is based on
	X.i readnews
	Xbut has a CRT-oriented (full screen) user interface.
	XThe command line options are identical.
	XThe list of available commands is quite similar,
	Xalthough since
	X.i vnews
	Xis a
	X.i visual
	Xinterface,
	Xmost
	X.i vnews
	Xcommands do not have to be terminated by a newline.
	X.pg
	X.i Vnews
	Xuses all but the last two lines of the screen to display the current article.
	XThe next to the last line is the secondary prompt line,
	Xand is used to input string arguments to commands.
	XThe last line contains several fields.
	XThe first field is the prompt field.
	XIf
	X.i vnews
	Xis at the end of an article,
	Xthe prompt is
	X.cf next? ;
	Xotherwise the prompt is
	X.cf more? .
	XThe second field is the newsgroup field,
	Xwhich displays the current newsgroup,
	Xthe number of the current article,
	Xand the number of the last article in the newsgroup.
	XThe third field contains the current time,
	Xand the last field contains the word
	X.cf mail
	Xif you have mail.

	Xappears in capital letters for 30 seconds.
	X.hu 2
	XCommands
	X.pg
	XMost of the
	X.i readnews
	Xcommands have
	X.i vnews
	Xcounterparts and vice versa.
	XSome differences are:
	X.si
	X.lp \(bu 5
	XIt lacks a \*(lqdigest\*(rq command (to deal specially with collections
	Xof articles bundled together).
	XThis would be nice to have,
	Xbut it does not seem to be a major deficiency
	Xsince you can move around in the digest with
	X.i vnews
	Xcommands.
	X.lp \(bu 5
	XTo get to the previous group,
	Xuse the
	X.qp N
	Xcommand with a
	X.qp \-
	Xargument.
	X.lp \(bu 5
	X.i Vnews
	Xhas commands for moving around in the article which
	X.i readnews
	Xdoes not have since they aren't applicable.
	X.lp \(bu 5
	XIt has a \*(lqparent\*(rq command which will go to the article
	Xthat the current article is a follow-up to,
	Xand a \*(lqwrite\*(rq
	Xcommand that writes out the body of an article without the header.
	X.lp \(bu 5
	XYou can refer to the current article from the shell or
	Xwhile writing a follow-up as
	X.b $A .
	X.lp \(bu 5
	XThe \*(lqdecrypt\*(rq command (for decoding possibly offensive
	Xmaterial) always does
	X.i rot13
	Xwhich seems to be the default standard but the
	X.i readnews
	Xversion of it occasionally gets confused.
	X.ei
	X.hu 2
	XCommands that differ from
	X.bi readnews
	X.pg
	XEach
	X.i vnews
	Xcommand may be preceded by a
	X.i count .
	XSome commands use the count; others ignore it.
	XIf
	X.i count
	Xis omitted,
	Xit defaults to one.
	XSome commands prompt for an argument
	Xon the second line from the bottom of the screen.
	XStandard
	X.ux
	Xerase and kill processing is done on this argument.
	XThe argument is terminated by a return.
	XAn interrupt
	X.qc DELETE "" (
	Xor
	X.qc BREAK )
	Xgets you out of any partially entered command. 
	X.Qc CR
	XA carriage return prints more of the current article,
	Xor goes on to the next article if you are at the end of the current article.
	XA
	X.qc SPACE
	Xis equivalent to
	X.qc CR .
	X.Qc CONTROL-B
	XGo backwards
	X.i count
	Xpages.
	X.Qc CONTROL-F
	XGo forward
	X.i count
	Xpages.
	X.Qc CONTROL-D
	XGo forwards half a page.
	X.Qc CONTROL-U
	XGo backwards half a page.
	X.Qc CONTROL-N
	XGo forwards
	X.i count
	Xlines.
	X.Qc CONTROL-Z
	XGo backwards
	X.i count
	Xlines.
	X.Qc CONTROL-L
	XRedraw the screen.
	X.qc CONTROL-L
	Xmay be typed at any time.
	X.Qp b
	XBack up one article in the current group.
	X.Qp l
	XRedisplay the article after you have sent a follow-up or reply.
	X.Qp n
	XMove on to the next item in a digest.
	X.qp \*(lq\&.\*(rq
	Xis equivalent to
	X.qp n .
	XThis is convenient if your terminal has a keypad.
	X.Qp p
	XShow the parent article
	X(the article that the current article is a follow-up to).
	XThis doesn't work if the current article was posted by A-news or notesfiles.
	XTo switch between the current and parent articles,
	Xuse the
	X.qp \-
	Xcommand.
	XUnfortunately,
	Xif you use several
	X.qp p
	Xcommands
	Xto trace the discussion back further,
	Xthere is no command to return to the original level.
	X.Qp ug
	XUnsubscribe to the current group.
	XThis is a two character command to ensure that it is not typed accidentally
	Xand to leave room for other types of unsubscribes
	X.i e\f1.\fPg ., (
	Xunsubscribe to discussion).
	X.Qp v
	XPrint the current version of the news software.
	X.Qp D
	XDecrypts a joke.
	XIt only handles
	X.pa rot13
	Xjokes.
	XThe
	X.qp D
	Xcommand is a toggle;
	Xtyping another
	X.qp D
	Xre-encrypts the joke.

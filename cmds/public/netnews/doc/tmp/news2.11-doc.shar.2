	XIntroduction
	X.pg
	XThis document is intended to help
	Xa USENET site install and maintain the network news software.
	XPlease ask questions of Rick Adams\*(dg;
	X.fn
	X\*(dg ARPANET: rick@seismo.CSS.GOV, UUCP: seismo!rick
	X.ef
	Xsuch questions will help to point out areas that need
	Xto be addressed here.
	X.pg
	XThe overall order of things to do is:
	X.lp (a)
	XFind somebody to link up with.
	XYou need a network connection of some kind,
	Xfor example,
	XARPANET or UUCP.
	XIf you must use UUCP and have no connections,
	Xyou must have at least a dialup and preferably a dialer,
	Xand find someone willing to call your machine.
	XThe USENET directory may be helpful in finding some other site geographically
	Xnear yours to hook up to.
	X.lp (b)
	XCreate a
	X.i localize.sh
	Xscript to make local changes to the makefile and
	X.i defs.h
	Xfiles. (Section 2 gives more details about creating
	X.i localize.sh \&.)
	XOnce you're finished editing
	X.i localize.sh ,
	Xcreate a
	X.i defs.h
	Xand
	X.i Makefile
	Xtailored
	Xfor your site with the command
	X.ce
	Xsh localize.sh
	XInspect
	X.i defs.h
	Xand
	X.i Makefile
	Xto ensure that all your local customizations
	Xgot into your final versions. If you saw a \*(lq?\*(rq when you ran
	X.i localize.sh ,
	Xone or both of the files is certainly wrong. It's a good idea to
	Xanchor the patterns in
	X.i localize.sh \&'s
	X.i ed (1)
	Xscripts, especially in its
	X.i Makefile -editing
	Xlines. For instance, use
	X.b /^UUXFLAGS/
	Xinstead of
	X.b /UUXFLAGS/ .
	X.lp (c)
	XCompile the software using the
	X.i make (1)
	Xcommand.
	X.lp (d)
	X.i Su (1)
	Xand type \*(lqmake install\*(rq.
	XThis will copy the files out to the right place and
	Xmake directories containing most of the important files.
	XIt will configure you in with a connection to
	X.cn oopsvax
	Xvia UUCP links.
	XThis is undoubtedly wrong,
	Xso you will have to configure links as needed.
	XIf this is your initial installation or you are upgrading from a version older
	Xthan 2.11, do \*(lqmake update\*(rq.
	XThis will cause various checks to be performed on important
	Xfiles in
	X.b LIBDIR .
	XThe results will be reported to you.
	XIf you are not sure if you should do \*(lqmake update\*(rq, do it.
	XIt will not hurt anything if you have already done it.
	X.lp (e)
	XAfter editing the configuration table,
	Xget your contact at the other end of the link to add you to their netnews
	X.i sys
	Xfile.
	X.lp (f)
	XPost a message to the
	X.bi sysname "" \f3to.\fP
	Xnewsgroup which should be set up to go only to the site you are linked to,
	Xas a test.
	XHave the other person send a message to your system using the same mechanism.
	XIf this doesn't work,
	Xfind the problem and fix it.
	X(Please don't use
	X.ng misc.test
	Xunless there is no alternative.
	XIt is almost always possible to use
	X.ng test ,
	Xor
	X.bi sysname "" \f3to.\fP
	Xor some
	X.bi local \f3.test\fP
	Xgroup,
	Xinstead of
	X.ng misc.test .)
	X.lp (g)
	XFill out a USENET directory form (the file
	X.i dirform
	Xin the
	X.i misc
	Xdirectory).
	XPost a copy to the USENET newsgroup
	X.ng news.newsite
	Xand mail a copy to
	X.i cbosgd!uucpmap .
	X.lp (h)
	XFormat the document
	X.i "\\*(lqHow to Read the Network News\\*(rq"
	X(the file
	X.i howto.mn
	Xin the
	X.i doc
	Xdirectory),
	Xthe document
	X.i "\\*(lqHow to Use USENET Effectively\\*(rq"
	X(the file
	X.i manner.mn
	Xin the
	X.i doc
	Xdirectory)
	Xand the document
	X.i "\\*(lqCopyright Law\\*(rq"
	X(the file
	X.i copyright.mn
	Xin the
	X.i doc
	Xdirectory)
	Xand post them to your
	X.ng general
	Xnewsgroup with a long expiration date.
	XYou can use
	X.i inews (1)
	Xor
	X.i postnews (1)
	Xto do this.
	X.lp (i)
	XIt will probably be necessary to fix your uucp commands
	Xto allow
	X.i rnews
	Xand to support the
	X.op \-z
	Xand
	X.op \-n
	Xoptions (if you are lucky enought to have the source).
	X.hn
	XInstallation
	X.hn 2
	XConfiguration
	X.pg
	XLocal configuration of the USENET
	Xversion B software requires you to edit a few files.
	XMost importantly,
	Xthe
	X.i defs.h
	Xand
	X.i Makefile
	Xfiles must be created from their templates
	X.i defs.dist
	Xand
	X.i Makefile.dst .
	XYou should create a shell script called
	X.i localize.sh
	Xwhich copies the files and makes local changes to the copies.
	XEven for a completely vanilla site,
	Xsome changes will be necessary.
	XFor example,
	Xyour script should start with
	X.i localize.v7
	Xor
	X.i localize.usg .
	XYou should include the name of the local organization
	X.b MYORG ) (
	Xand the uid of the local news super user
	X.b ROOTID ). (
	XYou should also choose how your hostname will be determined.
	XIf you are a USG site,
	Xdefine
	X.b UNAME
	Xin
	X.i defs.h .
	XIf you are
	Xrunning 4.[23] BSD,
	Xdefine
	X.b GHNAME
	Xin
	X.i defs.h .
	XIf you have your UUCP name in a file,
	Xdefine
	X.b UUNAME
	Xin
	X.i defs.h 
	Xto the name of that file.
	XOtherwise,
	Xnews will look in the file
	X.i /usr/include/whoami.h
	Xfor a line of the form
	X.sd c
	X#define sysname your-sysname
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XIf you are running System 3 or System 5,
	Xyou are a USG site.
	XOtherwise,
	Xunless you are in AT&T,
	Xyou are probably a V7 site.
	XThe previously mentioned defines are the only modifications that are
	X.i necessary
	Xto install news at your site.
	XHowever,
	Xyou will probably want to change some of the ones listed below.
	XIf your compiler does not accept \*(lq(void)\*(rq,
	Xthe simplest thing to do is add \*(lq\-Dvoid=int\*(rq to the
	X.b CFLAGS
	Xline in the
	X.i Makefile .
	X.pg
	XA sample localize shell script can be found in
	X.i localize.sample .
	XThe most important parameters are:
	X.hn 3
	XROOTID
	X.pg
	XThe numerical uid of the person who is the news super user.
	XThis should not be set to 0.
	XNormally it is set to the uid of the news contact person for the site.
	XIf it is not defined,
	Xthe uid of
	X.b NOTIFY
	Xwill be looked up in
	X.i /etc/passwd
	Xand used instead.
	X.hn 3
	XN_UMASK
	X.pg
	XMask for
	X.i umask (2)
	Xsystem call.
	XSet it to something like 022 for a secure system.
	XUnsecure systems might want 002 or 000.
	XThis mask controls the mode of news files created by the software.
	XInsecure modes would allow people to edit the files directly.
	X.hn 3
	XDFLTEXP
	X.pg
	XThe default number of seconds after which an article will expire.
	XTwo weeks (1,209,600 seconds) is the default choice.
	XIf you wish to expire articles faster than two weeks,
	Xit is recommended that you use the
	X.op \-e
	Xflag to expire instead of decreasing
	X.b DFLTEXP .
	X.hn 3
	XHISTEXP
	X.pg
	XArticles which were posted more than
	X.b HISTEXP
	Xago are considered too old and are moved into the
	X.ng junk
	Xdirectory.
	XThis is because they are too old to be in the history file,
	Xso it is impossible to tell if they really should be accepted
	Xor are endlessly looping around the network.
	X(This was theoretically possible before this feature was added.)
	XThe articles are removed after
	X.b DFLTEXP
	Xseconds,
	Xbut a copy of their
	X.hf Message-ID
	Xis kept in the history file for
	X.b HISTEXP
	Xseconds (the default is 4 weeks).
	XIf you are a
	X.i leaf
	Xnode, you do not need to have 
	X.b HISTEXP
	Xlonger than 
	X.b DFLTEXP .
	XHowever, major nodes with more than one news feed should have 
	X.b HISTEXP
	Xset to the default 4 weeks if possible.
	X
	X.hn 3
	XDFLTSUB
	X.pg
	XThe default subscription list.
	XIf a user does not specify any list of newsgroups,
	Xthis will be used.
	XPopular choices are
	X.ng all
	Xand
	X.ng general\f1,\fPall.general .
	X.hn 3
	XTMAIL
	X.pg
	XThis is the version of the Berkeley
	X.i Mail (1)
	Xprogram that has the
	X.op \-T
	Xoption.
	XIf left undefined,
	Xthe
	X.op \-M
	Xoption to
	X.i readnews (1)
	Xwill be disabled.
	X.hn 3
	XADMSUB
	X.pg
	XThis newsgroup (or newsgroup list) will always be selected
	Xunless the user specifies a newsgroup list that doesn't include
	X.b ADMSUB
	Xon the command line.
	XThat is,
	Xas long as the user doesn't use the
	X.op \-n
	Xflag to
	X.i readnews
	Xon the command line,
	X.b ADMSUB
	Xwill always be selected.
	XThis is usually set to
	X.ng general,all.announce .
	X(The intent of this parameter is to have certain newsgroups
	Xwhich users are required to subscribe to.
	XA typical site might require
	X.op general .)
	X.hn 3
	XPAGE
	X.pg
	XThe default program to which articles should be piped for paging.
	XThis can be disabled or changed by the environment variable
	X.b PAGER .
	XIf you have it,
	Xthe Berkeley
	X.i more (1)
	Xcommand should be used,
	Xsince the
	X.op +
	Xoption allows the headers to be skipped.
	X.hn 3
	XNOTIFY
	X.pg
	XIf defined,
	Xthis character string will be used as a user name to send mail
	Xto in the event of certain control messages of interest.
	X(Currently these are
	X.b newgroup ,
	X.b rmgroup ,
	X.b sendsys ,
	X.b checkgroups ,
	Xand
	X.b senduuname .)
	XAs distributed,
	Xmail will be sent to user
	X.i usenet .
	XIt is recommended you create such a mailbox
	X(have it forwarded to yourself) if possible,
	Xsince this makes it easier for another site
	Xto contact the site administrator for your site.
	XIf you are unable to do this
	X.i e\f1.\fPg ., (
	Xyou are not the super user)
	Xyou should change this name to yourself.
	XAlso,
	Xmessages about missing or extra newsgroups are mailed to this user
	Xby the
	X.b checkgroups
	Xcontrol message.
	X.hn 3
	XDFTXMIT
	X.pg
	XThis is the default command to use to transmit news
	Xif no explicit command is given in the fourth field of the
	X.i sys
	Xfile.
	XIt normally includes
	X.i uux (1)
	Xwith the
	X.op \-z
	Xoption.
	XYou should install this modification to UUCP at once;
	Xotherwise your users will be bombarded with annoying
	X.i uux
	Xcompletion messages.
	XHowever,
	Xyou can turn this off to get news installed.
	X.hn 3
	XUXMIT
	X.pg
	XThis is the default command used if the
	X.b U
	Xflag is present in the flags portion of a
	X.i sys
	Xfile line.
	XIn this case,
	Xthe second \*(lq%s\*(rq refers to the name of a file in the news spool area,
	Xnot a temporary file.
	XIt can usually only be used
	Xwhen local modifications are made to the uucp system,
	Xsuch as the
	X.op \-c
	Xoption to
	X.i uux .
	X.hn 3
	XDFTEDITOR
	X.pg
	XThis is the full path name of the default editor to use
	Xduring followups and replies.
	XIt should be set to the most popular text editor on your system.
	XAs distributed,
	X.i vi (1)
	Xis used.
	X.hn 3
	XUUPROG
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined,
	Xit will be used as a command to run when the
	X.b senduuname
	Xcontrol message is sent around.
	XOtherwise the command
	X.i uuname (1)
	Xwill be run.
	XNormally,
	Xthis program should be placed in
	X.b LIBDIR .
	X.hn 3
	XMANUALLY
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined,
	Xincoming
	X.b rmgroup
	Xmessages will not automatically remove the group.
	XNews will instead mail a message to
	X.b NOTIFY
	Xadvising that the group should be removed.
	XIf you define
	X.b MANUALLY ,
	Xyou should have
	X.b NOTIFY
	Xdefined.
	X.b MANUALLY
	Xis defined by default to protect you against
	Xaccidental or malicious removal of an important newsgroup.
	X.hn 3
	XNONEWGROUPS
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined, incoming
	X.b newgroup
	Xmessages will not automatically create the group.
	XNews will instead mail a message to
	X.b NOTIFY
	Xadvising that the group should be created.
	XIf you define
	X.b NONEWGROUPS ,
	Xyou should have
	X.b NOTIFY
	Xdefined.
	X.b NONEWGROUPS
	Xis undefined by default to make it easier to automatically maintain the
	Xnews system.
	X.hn 3
	XBATCH
	X.pg
	XIf set,
	Xthis is the name of a program that will be used to unpack
	Xbatched articles (those beginning with the character \*(lq#\*(rq).
	XBatched articles normally are files reading
	X.sd c
	X#! rnews 1234
	Xarticle containing 1234 characters
	X#! rnews 4321
	Xarticle containing 4321 characters
	X\\&. . .
	X.ed
	XBatching is
	X.i strongly
	Xrecommended for increased efficiency on both sides.
	X.hn 3
	XSPOOLNEWS
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined, all incoming news
	X.i inews "" (
	Xor
	X.i rnews )
	Xwill be placed in the directory
	X.b SPOOLDIR \f2/.rnews\fP
	Xfor later processing by
	X.i "rnews \-U" .
	XThis is useful when you want to appear to accept incoming news
	Xas soon as it arrives (to get it out of the
	X.i uuxqt
	Xqueue for example), but want to defer the actual processing until
	Xlater. If you define this option, make sure you invoke
	X.i "rnews \-U"
	Xfrom 
	X.i crontab
	Xregularly or you may wonder where your news is going!
	X.hn 3
	XLOCALNAME
	X.pg
	XMost systems have a full name database on line somewhere,
	Xshowing for each user what their full name is.
	XMost often this is in the gecos field of
	X.i /etc/passwd .
	XIf your system has such a database,
	X.b LOCALNAME
	Xshould be left undefined.
	XIf not,
	Xdefine
	X.b LOCALNAME ,
	Xand articles posted will only receive full names from local user information
	Xspecified in
	X.i NAME
	Xor
	X.bi $HOME \f2/.name\fP
	Xby the user.
	XIf you have a nonstandard gcos format
	X(not
	X.i finger (1)
	Xor RJE)
	Xit will be necessary to make local changes to
	X.i fullname.c
	Xas appropriate on your system.
	X.hn 3
	XINTERNET
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined, replies will use the
	X.hf "From"
	Xor
	X.hf "Reply-To"
	Xheaders of the news article.
	XOtherwise,
	Xleave it disabled and replies will use the
	X.hf "Path"
	Xheader.
	X.pg
	XYou can define this option even if your site does not understand
	Xinternet style headers. The file
	X.b LIBDIR \f2/mailpaths\fP
	Xcontains a line beginning with \*(lqinternet\*(rq.
	XThe rest of this line is a string for printf to use to route your
	Xmail to a site that does understand internet style headers. If your site
	Xunderstands internet style headers, this string would just be \*(lq%s\*(rq.
	XIf not, it might look like \*(lqseismo!%s\*(rq if
	X.i seismo
	Xwas your nearest site that understands that format.
	X.hn 3
	XMYDOMAIN
	X.pg
	XWhen generating internet addresses,
	Xthis domain will be appended to the local site name
	Xto form mailing address domains.
	XFor example,
	Xon system
	X.cn ucbvax
	Xwith user
	X.i root ,
	Xif
	X.b MYDOMAIN
	Xis set to
	X.cf .UUCP ,
	Xaddresses generated will read
	X.cf root@ucbvax.UUCP .
	XIf
	X.b MYDOMAIN
	Xis
	X.cf .Berkeley.EDU ,
	Xthe address would be
	X.cf root@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU .
	XIf your site is in more than one domain,
	Xuse your primary domain.
	XThe domain always begins with a period. If your site name contains the
	Xdomain, everything after the first \*(lq.\*(rq will be stipped off to
	Xget the news host name, so you still must define your domain name with 
	X.b MYDOMAIN .
	X.hn 3
	XCHEAP
	X.pg
	XDo not
	X.i chown (1)
	Xspool files to
	X.i news .
	XThis will cause the owner of the file to be the person that started
	Xthe
	X.i inews
	Xprocess.
	XThis is used for obscure accounting reasons on some systems.
	X.hn 3
	XOLD
	X.pg
	XDefine this if any of your USENET neighbors run
	X2.9 or earlier versions of B news.
	XIt will cause all headers written to contain two extra lines,
	X.hf Article-I.D.
	Xand
	X.hf Posted ,
	Xfor downward compatibility.
	XOnce all your neighbors have converted,
	Xyou can save disk space and transmission costs by turning this off.
	XIt is strongly encouraged that they convert.
	X2.11 is
	X.i much
	Xfaster than 2.9.
	XThe performance difference is dramatic.
	X.hn 3
	XUNAME
	X.pg
	XDefine this if the
	X.i uname (2)
	Xsystem call is available locally,
	Xeven though you are not a USG system.
	XUSG systems always have
	X.i uname (2)
	Xavailable and ignore this setting.
	X.hn 3
	XGHNAME
	X.pg
	XDefine this if the 4.[23] BSD
	X.i gethostname (2)
	Xsystem call is available.
	XIf neither
	X.b UNAME
	Xor
	X.b GHNAME
	Xis defined,
	X.i inews
	Xwill determine the name of the local system by reading
	X.i /usr/include/whoami.h .
	X.hn 3
	XUUNAME
	X.pg
	XDefine this to be the name of the file in which you store
	Xyour UUCP name. (If you store your UUCP name in a file.)
	X.hn 3
	XV7MAIL
	X.pg
	XDefine this if your system uses V7 mail conventions.
	XThe V7 mail convention is that
	Xa mailbox contains several messages concatenated,
	Xeach message beginning with a line reading
	X.hf "From \f2user date\fP"
	Xand ending in a blank line.
	XIf this is defined,
	Xarticles saved will have these lines added
	Xso that mail can be used to look at saved news.
	X.hn 3
	XSORTACTIVE
	X.pg
	XDefine this if you want the news groups presented in the order of each person's
	X.i .newsrc (5)
	Xinstead of the active file.
	X.hn 3
	XZAPNOTES
	X.pg
	XDefine this if you want old style notesfile id's in the body of the article
	Xto be converted into
	X.hf Nf-ID
	Xfields in the header and \*(lqOrphaned Responses\*(rq to be rejected.
	X.hn 3
	XDIGPAGE
	X.pg
	XIf this is defined,
	X.i vnews (1)
	Xwill attempt to process the subarticles
	Xof a digest instead of treating the article as one big file.
	X.hn 3
	XDOXREFS
	X.pg
	XDefine this if you are using
	X.i rn (1).
	X.i Rn
	Xuses this option to keep from showing the same article twice.
	X.hn 3
	XMULTICAST
	X.pg
	XIf your transport mechanism supports multi-casting of messages,
	Xdefine this.
	XCurrently ACSNET is the only network that can handle this.
	X.hn 3
	XBSD4_2
	X.pg
	XDefine this if you are running 4.2 or 4.3 BSD
	X.ux .

	XBSD4_1C
	X.pg
	XDefine this if you are running 4.1C BSD
	X.ux .
	X.hn 3
	XLOCKF
	X.pg
	XDefine this if your system supports the 
	X.i lockf ()
	Xsystem call as defined in the 
	X.i "System V Interface Definition" .
	XBe warned, many System V 
	X.ux
	Xsystems do not comply with the

	XSetting Up Links
	X.pg
	XThere are two basic types of links for exchanging news:
	Xthose that use mail and those that don't.
	XThe ones that use mail are more indirect,
	Xyet more versatile, while the ones that don't are simpler.
	XThe default method does not use mail, so that is discussed first.
	X.hn 2
	XNon-mail Links
	X.pg
	XThe basic theory behind a non-mail link is that the
	X.i rnews
	Xprogram is invoked on the remote system
	Xwith the article being transmitted as the standard input.
	XThis is possible on several networks,
	Xbut the most common implementation is via the UUCP network.
	XUsing the
	X.i uux
	Xcommand,
	Xthe command which is forked to the shell looks like:
	X.sd c
	Xuux \- \-r \-z remotesys!rnews < article
	X.ed
	XThis is the default transmission method.
	XIn order to set up such a link,
	Xobviously a UUCP link with the remote system must be in effect.
	XIn addition,
	X.i rnews
	Xmust be available and executable by
	X.i uuxqt
	Xon the remote machine.
	XIn most cases,
	Xthis means that
	X.i rnews
	Xmust be in
	X.i /usr/bin
	Xso
	X.i uux
	Xcan find it.

	XMail Links
	X.pg
	XWhen using mail to transmit articles,
	Xtwo intermediary programs are necessary.
	XThese are
	X.i sendnews
	Xand
	X.i uurec (8).
	XThe idea is that when system
	X.cn A
	Xwants to send an article to system
	X.cn B ,
	Xthe
	X.i sys
	Xfile on system
	X.cn A
	Xhas an entry for system
	X.cn B
	Xsuch as:
	X.sd c
	X/usr/lib/news/sendnews \-a rnews@B
	X.ed
	Xwhich runs
	X.i sendnews
	Xon the article.
	XThe
	X.op \-a
	Xoption specifies that the mail should be formatted for the ARPANET.
	X.i Sendnews
	Xpackages the article and mails it to
	X.cf rnews@B .
	XSomehow,
	Xthe B system is expected to make sure that all mail to user
	X.cf rnews
	Xis fed as input to the program
	X.i uurec .
	XThis program unpackages it and invokes
	X.i rnews .
	X.pg
	XThe best way to get mail to
	X.cf rnews
	Xfed into
	X.i uurec
	Xis to use
	X.i sendmail
	Xor
	X.i delivermail ,
	Xif you are on a system running them.
	XCreate an alias in
	X.i /usr/lib/aliases
	Xas follows:
	X.sd c
	Xrnews: "|/usr/lib/news/uurec"
	X.ed
	Xand
	X.i sendmail
	Xwill handle it.
	XIf you do not have a facility for forwarding mail to a program,
	Xyou can gimmick your mailer to watch for it
	X(using
	X.i popen (3S),
	Xthis is easy)
	Xor,
	Xif you don't want to do any programming,
	Xyou can have
	X.i cron (8)
	Xinvoke
	X.i uurec
	Xevery hour with
	X.i /usr/spool/mail/rnews
	Xas standard input.
	XThis solution is messier because
	X.i uurec
	Xmust potentially deal with multiple messages,
	Xsomething that has never been tested.
	X.hn 1
	XFormat of the
	X.bi sys
	Xfile
	X.pg
	XTo set up a link to another site,
	Xedit the
	X.i sys
	Xfile in
	X.b LIBDIR .
	XThis file is similar to the
	X.i L.sys
	Xfile of UUCP.
	XEach line contains four fields,
	Xseparated by colons:
	X.lp (1)
	XThe system name of a site to which you forward news.
	XNormally all systems you have links to will be
	Xincluded.
	XYou should also have a line for your own system.
	XIf this field is
	X.cn ME,
	Xit will be used as if it were your local system name.
	XIf the system name is followed by a \*(lq/\*(rq, the article will not be
	Xforwarded to this system if it has already passed through any of the
	X(comma separated) list of sites immediately following the \*(lq/\*(rq.
	XFor example, if the sysline was:
	X.sd c
	Xyoursite/sitea,siteb,sitec:world,comp,sci,news,rec,misc,na,usa,to.yoursite::
	X.ed
	Xthe incoming article would only be forwarded to
	X.i yoursite
	Xif it had not already been to any of
	X.i sitea ,
	X.i siteb ,
	Xor
	X.i sitec .
	XThis is normally used to reduce the number of duplicate articles received
	Xat a site that has multiple main newsfeeds.
	X.lp (2)
	XThe newsgroups to be forwarded to that site.
	XThis is a pattern of the same kind as a subscription list.
	XGenerally,
	Xyou will list classes of newsgroups,
	Xthat is,
	Xusing
	X.ng all
	Xfor everything.
	XA typical forwarding list for a new site would be
	X.sd c
	Xworld,comp,sci,news,rec,misc,soc,talk,na,usa,to.\f2sysname\fP
	X.ed
	Xwhere
	X.i sysname
	Xis the name of the remote system.
	X(Of course, if you are not in the USA or North America,
	Xyou would remove those distributions
	Xand replace them with the ones appropriate for you.)
	XIn particular,
	Xyou don't want to forward
	X.ng all
	Xsince local newsgroups
	X(those without dots)
	Xshould not be sent.
	XFor the line describing your own system,
	Xthis field describes the newsgroups your site will accept from remote sites.
	XThus,
	Xif another site insists on sending you a newsgroup you don't want,
	Xfor example
	X.ng rec.humor ,
	Xinclude
	X.ng !rec.humor
	Xhere.
	X.lp (3)
	XThis field contains flags describing the connection.
	X.Qp A
	Xindicates that the other site is running an A version of netnews.
	X.Qp B
	Xindicates a B version.
	XLeaving it empty defaults to
	X.b B .
	XIf you are reading this document,
	Xyou have a B version.
	XSome existing sites run A versions.
	XIf you aren't sure,
	Xask your contact at the other site,
	Xwith whom you should be talking to set this up anyway.
	X.Qp F
	Xindicates that the fourth field is the name of a file.
	XThe full path name of a file containing the article in
	X.b SPOOL
	Xwill be appended to this file. If the fourth field is blank, the filename
	X.b BATCHDIR \f2/sysname\fP,
	X(where
	X.i sysname
	Xis specified in the first field) will be used.
	X.Qp L
	Xprevents transmission unless the article was created on this site.
	XIf a number follows the
	X.b L
	X.i e\f1.\fPg ., (
	X.b L3 ),
	Xsites less than that number of hops away will be considered local.
	X(It is recommended that you feed an
	X.b L
	Xlink to a backbone site,
	Xto ensure that your submissions will be more likely
	Xto get to the entire network,
	Xeven in the event of a local problem.
	XPlease make sure that a mail link exists too,
	Xso you can get replies.)
	X.Qp H
	Xcan be used to interpolate the history file into the command.
	X.Qp S
	Xsays to execute the transmission command directly
	Xinstead of forking a shell.
	X.Qp U
	Xarranges that the parameter to the optional \*(lq%s\*(rq
	Xin the command field to be filled in with a permanent file name from
	X.b SPOOL
	Xinstead of a temporary customized file name.
	X.Qp M
	Xsays to use multi-casting. Multi-casting is described in an appendix.
	X.Qp I
	Xautomatically defines the
	X.b F
	Xflag. However, it puts the article's 
	X.i Message-Id
	Xinto the file instead of the filename containing the article. This is
	Xused with the 
	X.i ihave/sendme
	Xcontrol messages.
	X.Qp m
	X(lower case
	X.b m
	Xnot upper case
	X.b M )
	Xmodifies the newsgroup pattern match to only return true if it
	Xmatches the pattern in the second field AND the group is moderated.
	XFor example, if your
	X.i sys
	Xfile looked like:
	X.sd c
	Xavax:world,comp,sci:mF:/usr/spool/batch/avax.sendimmediately
	Xavax:world,comp,sci,rec,talk,misc,soc,to.avax:F
	X.ed
	X.ei
	Xany moderated articles in the newsgroups
	X.ng comp
	Xor 
	X.ng sci
	Xwould be placed in the file
	X.i avax.sendimmediately 
	Xin the 
	X.b SPOOL
	Xdirectory.
	XAll other news for that machine would be placed in the file
	X.i avax .
	XYou could then transmit the articles in
	X.i avax.sendimmediately
	Xmore often than the rest of the news.
	X.Qp u
	Xworks like
	X.b m
	Xexcept that it only matches un-moderated newsgroups.
	X.Qp N
	Xindicates that news should be sent using the ihave/sendme protocol.
	XIt should not really be used anymore as
	X.b I
	Xis much more efficient.
	X.lp (4)
	XThis field is the command to be run to send news to the remote site.
	XThe article will be on the standard input.
	XLeaving this field blank means an ordinary UUCP link is being used,
	Xthat is,
	Xthe command defaults to
	X.sd c
	Xuux \- \-r \-z sysname!rnews
	X.ed
	XThe
	X.op \-
	Xoption tells
	X.i uux
	Xto expect input from the standard input.
	XThe
	X.op \-z
	Xoption is nonstandard \- you should add it
	X(see the
	X.i minus.z
	Xfiles in the uucp source directory).
	XIt shuts off the annoying message you would otherwise get mailed to you
	Xtelling you that your article was broadcast successfully.
	XTo avoid using the
	X.op \-z
	Xoption,
	Xchange the source or put the
	X.i uux
	Xcommand in the fourth field.
	XThe
	X.op \-r
	Xoption tells
	X.i uux
	Xnot to call the other system once the job is queued.
	XThis turns out to ease the load on the system,
	Xat the expense of making news be transmitted a bit slower.
	XThe news will be sent when the next call is made;
	Xusually this means the next time mail is sent to or from your system.
	XIf this turns out to be unreasonably long,
	Xput a line in
	X.i crontab
	Xto run
	X.sd c
	X/usr/lib/uucp/uucico \-r1 \-s\f1sysname\fP

	XPosting Methods
	X.pg
	XThe basic method is
	X.i postnews .
	XThis program will prompt you for the title,
	Xnewsgroups,
	Xand distribution,
	Xthen place you in the editor.
	X(The system default
	X.b EDITOR
	Xis used unless the environment variable
	X.b EDITOR
	Xis set,
	Xoverriding the system default.)
	XThe text should be typed after the blank line.
	XThe title and newsgroups are available for editing at the top of the buffer.
	XOther header lines can be added,
	Xsuch as an expiration date or a distribution.
	XWhen you write out the file and exit from the editor,
	Xyou will be prompted for what to do next. Your choices are:
	X.b w rite
	Xthe message to a file,
	X.b s end
	Xthe message,
	X.b l ist
	Xthe message or
	X.b e dit
	Xit again.
	X.pg
	XAnother method is to use mail.
	XThis can only be done on systems that allow mail to a given name
	Xto be fed into an arbitrary program as input.
	XThis is easily done with the Berkeley
	X.i delivermail
	Xor
	X.i sendmail
	Xprogram,
	Xand not with any other mailer the author is familiar with.
	X(It may be possible to painfully set this up with MMDF,
	Xprovided the newsgroup name is no more than 8 characters long.)
	XTo use mail,
	Xset up an alias such as the following:
	X.sd c
	Xsci.physics: "|/usr/lib/news/recnews sci.physics"
	X.ed
	XWhenever a user sends mail to
	X.ng sci.physics ,
	Xthis starts up the given shell command which calls
	X.ng recnews
	Xwith one argument,
	Xthe name of the newsgroup.
	XYou need to create one alias for each newsgroup,
	Xand to keep the list up to date as new newsgroups are created.
	X.i Recnews (8)
	Xwill in turn invoke
	X.i inews .
	X.pg
	XNote that there are problems with
	X.i recnews .
	XThere is no way to use it to post to multiple newsgroups
	Xwithout creating separate articles
	X(something frowned upon because it forces people
	Xto read the same thing more than once).
	XAlso,
	Xthere is no way to make the recording feature
	X(to remind people to not accidently divulge proprietary information)
	Xwork when recnews is used.

	XVarious considerations

	XSpooling
	X.pg
	XIf
	X.i expire
	Xis already running and
	X.i inews 
	Xor
	X.i rnews
	Xis invoked, the incoming article will be saved in
	X.b SPOOLDIR /\f2.rnews\fP
	Xfor later processing by
	X.i "rnews \-U" .
	XThis is to prevent the incoming article from getting 
	X"lost" and not being in the history file.
	X.i Expire
	Xautomatically runs 
	X.i "rnews \-U"
	Xwhen it has finished.
	XIf you have defined
	X.b SPOOLNEWS ,
	Xyou should also invoke
	X.i "rnews \-U"
	Xfrom crontab on a regular basis.
	X.hn 2
	XSetuid bits
	X.pg
	XThe current intended state of affairs is that
	X.i inews
	Xruns setuid to
	X.b NEWSUSR .
	XThe
	X.i readnews
	Xand 
	X.i vnews
	Xprograms do not need to be setuid.
	XThis makes it possible to write your own interface to read news instead of using
	X.i readnews .
	X(As distributed,
	X.i inews
	Xis also setgid.
	XI know of no good reason for this.)
	X.hn 2
	XModes of Spool Directories
	X.pg
	XAll the files should be writable by
	X.b NEWSUSR .
	XHowever,
	Xdue to a glitch,
	Xyou will probably have to make the
	X.b SPOOLDIR
	Xand its subdirectories mode 777.
	XIt could be 755 except for one problem.
	XWhen a new newsgroup comes in,
	X.i inews
	Xwill attempt to
	X.i mkdir (1)
	Xa new subdirectory of
	X.b SPOOLDIR
	Xfor the newsgroup.
	XSince both
	X.i inews
	Xand
	X.i mkdir
	Xare setuid,
	X.i mkdir
	Xwill use the uid of the person who ran 
	X.i inews
	Xinstead of
	X.b NEWSUSR
	Xwhen checking for permissions.
	XIf the directory mode isn't 777 the check will fail.
	X4.[23] BSD sites do not have this problem as 
	X.i mkdir ()
	Xis a system call and will create the directory with the \*(lqcorrect\*(rq
	Xownership.
	XHere are several alternatives if you don't want a 777 directory around:
	X.hn 3
	XFix Real Uid
	X.pg
	XIf
	X.i inews
	Xis always run by
	X.i cron
	Xor as
	X.i root ,
	Xthe real uid can be arranged to be
	X.i root
	Xor
	X.b NEWSUSR .
	XThis is a poor solution
	Xsince it makes the local creation of new newsgroups
	Xrequire super user permissions,
	Xand is a potential security hole.
	XIf this approach is taken,
	Xcare must be taken to ensure that the owner of the created directory is
	X.b NEWSUSR .
	X.hn 3
	XChange the Kernel
	X.pg
	X.i Inews
	Xwill do:
	X.b setuid(geteuid())
	X(see
	X.i setuid (2)
	Xand
	X.i geteuid (2))
	Xbefore it forks the
	X.i mkdir .
	XIf your system permits this call,
	Xthere will be no problem.
	XIn particular,
	XBerkeley 4.0
	X.ux
	Xand later systems allow this.
	XAn alternative change to the kernel is to automatically stack uids:
	Xwhen a setuid program is run,
	Xset the new real uid to the old effective uid.
	X.hn 3
	XGroups
	X.pg
	XYou could have
	X.i inews
	Xbe setgid to
	X.b NEWSGRP
	Xand all files writable by the group.
	XThis approach has been tested and the problem turns out to be that the
	X.i mkdir
	Xcommand uses the
	X.i access (2)
	Xsystem call to check permissions.
	XSince
	X.i access
	Xuses the real gid,
	Xyou run into the same problem.
	X.hn 3
	XAnother
	X.bi Mkdir
	X.pg
	XYou could create a version of
	X.i mkdir
	Xthat does less checking and put it in a directory that can only be accessed by
	X.b NEWSUSR
	X(mode 700,
	Xowned by
	X.b NEWSUSR ).
	XHave
	X.i inews
	Xfork this
	X.i mkdir .

	X.i crontab
	Xto run
	X.sd c

	X.ed
	Xevery night.
	XThis command deletes all expired news.
	XThe
	X.op \-a
	X.i newsgroups

	X.i /usr/spool/oldnews
	Xdepending on which newsgroups are selected.
	X(See

	XControl Messages
	X.pg
	XSome news systems will send you articles that are not for human consumption.
	XThey are messages to your news system called
	X.i "control messages" .
	XSuch messages contain the
	X.hf Control
	Xheader.
	XOlder systems use newsgroups matching
	X.ng all.all.ctl ,
	Xand this will still work,
	Xalthough the
	X.hf Control
	Xheader is preferred.
	XSince the newsgroup name is used for distribution only,
	Xand is not checked to ensure it's in the active file,
	Xsuch newsgroup names can still be used.
	XThis makes it possible to post network wide control messages with
	X.ng world.msg.ctl
	X(or restricted broadcast such as
	X.ng btl.msg.ctl )
	Xor messages for a particular system:
	X.ng to.ucbvax.ctl .
	XMessages are canceled,
	Xhowever,
	Xwith a
	X.hf Control
	Xline in a message to the same newsgroup(s)
	Xas the original message.
	X.pg
	XA control message contains a command and zero or more arguments
	X(much like a

	Xihave/sendme
	X.pg
	XTwo control messages are
	X.b ihave

	X.b sendme .
	XThese messages allow two participating sites to set up a link
	Xso that one site will tell the other site it has a given article
	Xand wait for a request before it actually sends it.
	XThe normal case is to send an entire article to a system,
	Xwhich consults the history file to see if the article has already been seen,
	Xand then throws it away if it has been seen before.
	X.pg
	XUse of these control messages can cut down on this wasted transmission,
	Xbut if you have a polled UUCP connection,
	Xthey can slow down receipt of news due to polling delays.
	XIt is up to each connected pair of sites whether they want to use this protocol.
	XThe choice is controlled by the
	X.b I
	Xflag in the
	X.i sys
	Xfile.
	XIn the case of a leaf node
	X(one with only one neighbor)
	Xthere is no advantage to this protocol.
	XEven if both sites are able to initiate a connection
	X(have dialers or the link is hard wired)
	Xthe
	X.op \-r
	Xoption on the
	X.i uux
	Xcan cause 2 hour or more delays in propagating news.
	XIf transmission time and phone bills dominate your costs,
	Xand you are sending news to several sites,
	Xand large article bodies dominate the costs
	X(rather than the headers and the time spent by UUCP negotiating transmission)
	Xit is probably worthwhile to use
	X.pa ihave/sendme .
	XIf your costs are dominated by CPU load from UUCP,
	Xor if you send news to a site that cannot get it from anywhere else,
	Xyou probably do not want to use this protocol.
	XThe decision can be made independently for each site in your
	X.i sys
	Xfile.
	X.pg
	XTo use the ihave/sendme protocol, you should have the
	X.b I
	Xflag defined in the sys file for the remote site. For example:
	X.sd c
	Xarlene:world,na,usa,comp,sci,news,rec,soc,misc,talk,to.elsie:IF
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XNormally, a message arrives at this site, is found to be ok (i.e. it hasn't
	Xalready been received), and is considered for retransmission to other
	Xsites. If the system you are sending to has the
	X.B I
	Xflag defined, the Message-ID
	Xis saved in the file specified in the sys entry. 
	X.pg
	XAfter a period of time,
	X.i "sendbatch -i arlene" ,
	Xis run by 
	X.i cron (8).  
	XIt takes this file, makes it into an 
	X.b ihave
	Xcontrol message, and sends it to the other site.
	XWhen the message is received on the other site, the Message-IDs
	Xare looked up, and if any of the messages have not been received, they are put
	Xinto a 
	X.b sendme
	Xcontrol message. When the
	X.b ihave
	Xmessage has been fully processed, 
	Xthe
	X.b sendme
	Xmessage is sent to the site that sent the 
	X.b ihave
	Xmessage.
	X.pg
	XWhen the orignal site receives the
	X.b sendme
	Xmessage, it sends the requested articles in the format designated by the 
	X.i sys
	Xfile (the 
	X.b I 
	Xflag is ignored in this case).  In this example, it would write into the

	XMaintenance
	X.pg
	XThere are some things you should do periodically
	Xto keep your news system running smoothly.
	XWe hope to eventually automate all or most of this,
	Xbut right now some of it must be done by hand.
	X.pg
	XThe
	X.i history
	Xand
	X.i log
	Xfiles in your
	X.b LIBDIR
	Xdirectory will grow.
	XYou should make sure that they are cleaned up periodically.
	XThe
	X.bi LIBDIR \f2/expire\fP
	Xprogram will remove lines from history corresponding to deleted articles,
	Xbut it is a good idea to check the file every few weeks
	Xto make sure it is not going wild.
	XBe sure not to completely lose your history file when you clean it up,
	Xin case another neighbor tries to send you an article you recently got.
	X(If you only get news from one site it is safe to clean it out completely.)
	X.pg
	XThe log file is not automatically cleaned out by any netnews software,
	Xand will grow quickly.
	XThe
	X.i misc/trimlib
	Xscript can be installed in
	X.bi LIBDIR \f2/trimlib\fP,
	Xand invoked weekly by
	X.i cron (8).
	X.pg
	XYou should also clean out old newsgroups that are no longer active.
	XTo remove a newsgroup
	X.ng misc.foo ,
	Xyou should run the shell script
	X.i rmgroup
	Xwith
	X.b misc.foo
	Xas the argument.
	XThat is,
	X.sd c
	X/usr/lib/news/rmgroup misc.foo
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XNote that clearing up UUCP constipation is another thing you'll have to do
	Xif you have flaky hardware or phone lines.
	XIf you have more than one connection,
	Xchances are that UUCP will get clogged up when one of your neighbors goes down
	Xfor more than a few hours.
	XVarious spooling schemes are being worked on
	Xto help make the news/uucp system more robust,
	Xbut one thing you can and should do,
	Xif you find your
	X.i /usr/spool/uucp
	Xdirectory getting too big,
	Xis to install a subdirectory fix to UUCP.
	XA quick and dirty version of this is available from Duke,
	Xwhich traps the file-oriented system calls
	Xat the assembly language level and maps,
	Xfor example,
	XD.fooA1234 into D.foo/D.fooA1234.
	XSince the C. and
	X.i local "" D.
	Xdirectories still get big,
	Xin practice this can still create some big directories,
	Xbut the directories tend to be a factor of 5 smaller,
	Xresulting in a factor of 25 improvement to speed
	X(since a directory traversal for all files is quadratic on
	X.ux ).
	XRight now, unless you have the uucp distributed with 4.3 BSD or the so called
	X.i HoneyDanBer
	Xuucp, 
	XUUCP is the weak link in netnews distribution,
	Xand you should certainly keep an eye on it.
	X.hn
	XCreating New Newsgroups
	X.pg
	XAs system news administrator,
	Xyou are able to create newsgroups.
	XTo create a newsgroup,
	Xfirst make sure this is the right thing to do.
	XNormally a suggestion is first posted to
	X.ng news.groups\f1,\fPwhatever.relatedgroup
	Xfor a world wide newsgroup
	X.b whatever.relatedgroup "" (
	Xshould be the group which you are proposing to sub-divide.
	XFor instance,
	Xto propose creating
	X.ng rec.arts.tv.soaps ,
	Xpost the original article to
	X.ng rec.arts.tv\f1,\fPnews.groups .)
	XFollowups are made to
	X.ng news.groups
	X.i only .
	X(You can force this by putting the line:
	X.sd c
	XFollowup-To: news.groups
	X.ed
	Xin the headers of your original posting.)
	XIf it is established that there is general interest in such a group,
	Xand a name is agreed on,
	Xthen someone creates it by typing the command
	X.sd c
	Xinews \-d local \-C \fInewsgroup\fP
	X.ed
	XThis will create the active entry locally. The directory will be
	Xcreated automatically when the first article for that newsgroup is
	Xreceived.
	XIt will also prompt you for a paragraph describing the group and start up an
	X.i inews
	Xto post a newgroup control message announcing the group.
	X.pg
	XYou must be the super user to use the
	X.op \-C
	Xoption to
	X.i inews .
	X(That is, your uid must match
	X.b ROOTID .
	XIt is recommended that you change
	X.b ROOTID
	Xto your own uid so you don't have to
	X.i su
	Xto create newsgroups.)
	XIf you change the distribution to be something other than local, the
	Xnewgroups message will be sent to the specified distribution.
	X.hn
	XConversion from A to B
	X.pg
	XIf you are currently running version A on your system,
	Xnote that B is incompatible with A.
	XThe files are stored in a different format
	X(headers have mail like field names now).
	XThe directory organization is different
	X(each newsgroup has a subdirectory of its own,
	Xand the file names are numbers rather than
	X.i site\f1.\fPid
	Xpairs).
	XThere are no
	X.i bitmap ,
	X.i uindex ,
	Xor
	X.i nindex
	Xfiles to be trashed
	X(which articles have been read is stored in each users
	X.i .newsrc
	Xfile).
	XThe user interface is slightly different
	X.i netnews (1) (news/
	Xis now called
	X.i readnews ,
	Xnews is posted using
	X.i inews ,
	Xsubscription is done by editing
	X.i .newsrc ,

	X.op \-x
	Xas well,
	Xand there are many minor changes).
	X.pg
	XWe decided not to provide a program to convert from version A to version B.
	XRather,
	Xthe following strategy was adopted for conversion:
	X.lp (1)
	XInstall the new news in a different spool directory from the old one.
	XFor example,
	Xyou can use
	X.i /usr/spool/newnews .
	XYou can change to the standard name later if you want.
	XGet it to work for local messages.
	X.lp (2)
	XPost an article to newsgroup
	X.b general
	Xwith the old news announcing the change.
	XMake available documentation such as the accompanying paper
	X.i "How to Read the Network News"
	Xto the users.
	XThis article will be the last one in the old news.
	X.lp (3)
	X.i Chmod
	Xthe old news directory to 555 to prevent any more news from being posted.
	X(Actually,
	Xthis will prevent the bitfile from being updated,
	Xso it may not be a good idea.)
	X.lp (4)
	XReplace the old
	X.i rnews
	Xprogram with the new
	X.i rnews
	Xprogram.
	X.lp (5)
	XTest it by having your neighbor send you a message.
	X.lp (6)
	XWait a reasonable period for everyone to have read the final article
	Xwith the old news.
	XPerhaps a few weeks is right.
	X.lp (7)
	XUninstall the old news.
	X.pg
	XUsers will have to invoke
	X.i readnews
	Xinstead of
	X.i netnews
	Xto read news.
	XDepending on your old method of posting,
	Xthis could be changed too.
	X(If you were using mail,
	Xit does not need to be changed.)
	XThey will also have to fix their subscriptions.
	XIn general,
	Xthey can type
	X.sd c
	Xnetnews \-s
	X.ed
	Xto see what they subscribe to on the old system,
	Xand then create a file in their home directory called
	X.i .newsrc
	Xcontaining
	X.sd c
	Xoptions \-n \f2their subscription\fP
	X.ed
	XThe format of the subscription pattern matching is the same as in A
	Xexcept that
	X.ng ALL
	Xis replaced by
	X.ng all
	X(change to lower case).
	XSomething along the lines of this could be used to automate this:
	X.sd c
	X(echo \-n "options \-s" ; netnews \-s | sed s/ALL/all/) > .newsrc
	X.ed
	X.hn
	XConversion from 2.9 to 2.11
	X.pg
	XConversion from 2.9 to 2.11 is not nearly as involved as an A to B conversion.
	XThe user interface does not change much,
	Xand the user
	X.i .newsrc
	Xfiles are not affected.
	XHowever,
	Xit is recommended that you do the conversion during a time
	Xwhen no news is received,
	Xso that incoming news will not get lost.
	XOne way to ensure this is to make
	X.i /usr/bin/rnews
	Xbe a shell script which saves the article in
	X.bi $$ "" /usr/spool/innews/
	X.bi $$ "" (
	Xis the process id of the particular shell and will be unique for each article).
	X.pg
	XThe first step to conversion is to customize the sources.
	XIn the past,
	Xyou had to take a fresh distribution and edit the
	X.i defs.h
	Xfile and
	X.i Makefile
	Xto suit local preferences.
	XIf you had many local changes,
	Xor didn't record the local changes,
	Xupgrading could be annoying.
	X2.11 provides a mechanism to automate these changes.
	XCreate a shell script in the src directory called
	X.i localize.sh .
	X(You can use
	X.i localize.sample
	Xas a template.)
	XThis shell script should copy
	X.i defs.dist
	Xto
	X.i defs.h ,
	Xand copy
	X.i Makefile.dst
	Xto
	X.i Makefile .
	XIt should
	X.i chmod
	Xany files that need to be changed
	X(often
	X.i Makefile
	Xand
	X.i defs.h )
	Xto a writable mode.
	XThen it should invoke
	X.i ed (1)
	Xon the files,
	Xmaking any necessary local changes.
	X.pg
	XThe next step is to compile the software,
	Xwith
	X.i make (1).
	XIt may be necessary to update the
	X.i localize.sh
	Xfile until you are satisfied with the compilation.
	XNote that after any change to the
	X.i Makefile
	Xin
	X.i localize.sh ,
	Xyou should run
	X.i localize.sh
	Xby hand.
	XOtherwise,
	Xalthough make will run it for you,
	Xit will then continue to do the make with the old
	X.i Makefile .
	X.pg
	XWhen the software is compiled,
	Xyou should run the
	X.i cvt.active.sh
	Xshell script,
	Xwith the
	X.i lib
	Xand
	X.i spool
	Xdirectories as parameters.
	XThis will create a new active file in
	X.bi LIBDIR \f2/active\fP.
	XThen run
	X.i cvt.links.sh
	Xwith the
	X.i lib
	Xand
	X.i spool
	Xdirectories as parameters.
	XThen run
	X.i cvt.names.sh
	Xwith the
	X.i lib
	Xand
	X.i spool
	Xdirectories as parameters.
	XOld news will be linked into the new hierarchy
	Xwhile leaving links in the old hierarchy.
	XIf you were using the default library and spool directories,
	Xyou would do the following:
	X.sd
	Xsh cvt.active.sh /usr/lib/news /usr/spool/news
	Xsh cvt.links.sh /usr/lib/news /usr/spool/news
	Xsh cvt.names.sh /usr/lib/news /usr/spool/news
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XThe next step is to back up the old binaries:
	X.sd
	Xmv /usr/bin/rnews /usr/bin/ornews
	X\&...
	X.ed
	Xand to install 2.11 with
	X.sd c
	Xmake install
	X.ed
	XOnce it is installed,
	Xany incoming news will be placed into the new hierarchy but not the old one.
	XThe critical time window is between running the three shell files and
	Xinstalling the new software \-
	Xany incoming news between these two points will appear
	Xin only the old hierarchy and be lost to the new software.
	XIf any significant time elapses here,
	Xyou should divert
	X.i rnews
	Xinto a separate spool directory as described above.
	X.pg
	XIt is crucial that you run
	X.i expire
	Xbefore any new news arrives.
	X.i Expire
	Xwill update several key files automatically.
	X.pg
	XFinally,
	Xtest things by posting articles to
	X.bi neighbor "" \f3to.\fP
	Xnewsgroups and watching some incoming news,
	Xand announce the change to your users.
	X.pg
	XWhen you are satisfied that the conversion was successful,
	Xrun the shell file
	X.i cvt.clean.sh
	Xwhich will remove the old 2.9 news hierarchy.

	XAppendix A: Setting up a Compressed, Batched Newsfeed
	X.pg
	XFirst,
	X.b BATCH 
	Xmust have been
	X.i #define 'd
	Xwhen you built the news system.
	XTo check,
	Xlook in the file
	X.i defs.h
	Xin the news source directory.
	X.b BATCH 
	Xshould be defined as a program name (by default,
	X.i unbatch ).
	XIf it's undefined or commented out,
	Xdefine it,
	Xre-make the news system,
	Xand install the new software.
	X.pg
	XYou'll also need a working
	X.i compress
	Xprogram.
	XUse the one shipped with this news distribution,
	Xwhich is based on version 4.0.
	XYour news neighbors should be running a compatible version of compress.
	XVersions 3.0 and 4.0 are compatible with each other,
	Xbut both are incompatible with versions 2.0 and earlier.
	X.pg
	XUpdate your
	X.i sys
	Xfile.
	XFirst, add the
	X.b F
	Xflag to the other news system's line.  For instance,
	Xif your compressed-and-batched news feed is named
	X.cn frobozz ,
	Xand its
	X.i sys
	Xfile entry looks like:
	X.si
	X.sd
	Xfrobozz:world,comp,sci,rec,misc,soc,talk,news,na,usa,ca,to.frobozz
	X.ed
	X.ei
	Xthen add the
	X.b F
	Xflag as the third (colon-separated) field:
	X.si
	X.sd
	Xfrobozz:world,comp,sci,rec,misc,soc,talk,news,na,usa,ca,to.frobozz:F
	X.ed
	X.ei
	XNow the pathnames of articles to be sent will be stashed in a file.
	XThis file can be specified in the fourth field of the
	X.i sys
	Xentry.
	XNormally, you can just use the default of 
	X.bi BATCHDIR \f2/system\fP,
	X(where
	X.bi BATCHDIR
	Xis usually
	X.i /usr/spool/batch
	Xand
	X.i system
	Xis the name of the remote system,
	Xin this example
	X.cn frobozz ).
	XA name of that form is necessary:
	Xthe
	X.i sendbatch
	Xscript,
	Xwhich sends the batched news,
	Xlooks for a file name of this form
	Xto decide if there's news for the remote system.
	X.pg
	XYour completed
	X.i sys
	Xfile line should look something like:
	X.si
	X.sd
	Xfrobozz:world,comp,sci,rec,misc,soc,talk,news,na,usa,to.frobozz:F
	X.ed
	X.ei
	X.pg
	XIn  your
	X.i crontab
	Xfile, find or create at least two news lines:
	Xone that runs nightly,
	Xand one that runs every hour or so.
	XThe nightly-run script should run
	X.i expire ,
	Xtrim log files,
	Xand perhaps compile weekly statistics
	Xthat you post to a local-area newsgroup one day a week.
	XThe hourly-run script should complete the transmitting task
	Xwith a line like:
	X.sd c
	Xsendbatch -c frobozz
	X.ed
	XMake sure the script knows how to get to the directory in which
	X.i sendbatch
	Xlives.
	XYou can either mention the directory in the script's
	X.b PATH -setting
	Xline,
	Xor replace
	X.i sendbatch
	Xwith its full pathname.
	X.i Sendbatch
	Xreads the files mentioned in
	X.i /usr/spool/batch/frobozz ,
	Xbatches them,
	Xoptionally compresses them,
	Xsends them to the remote system,
	Xand arranges for remote processing.
	X.pg
	XThis remote processing can be directed by another file in
	X.b BATCHDIR .
	XMake an executable file with a name of the form
	X.bi BATCHDIR \f2/system\fP.cmd
	X(for this example,
	X.i /usr/spool/batch/frobozz.cmd ).
	XPut a line in it specifying the command that the remote system
	Xshould execute to unpack the news batches that your system will send.
	XAn example
	X.i frobozz.cmd
	Xwould be:
	X.sd c
	Xuux - -r -z -n -gd frobozz!rnews
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XNow your system will transmit compressed batches.
	XThe receiving side of the business is handled largely by a program called
	X.i rnews ,
	Xwhich will call other programs in
	X.b LIBDIR
	Xto do additional processing on the incoming batches.
	X.pg

	Xflag.
	X.pg
	XIf the
	X.b M
	Xflag is set on some line in the

	Xfile,

	XThat is simply another system name,
	Xexpected to be found in the first field of some line in the

	Xfile (textually following the line containing the
	X.b M

	Xthe news system remembers the system name,
	Xalong with the multicast name (fourth field).
	X.pg
	XEventually the multicast system name is found in the first field of a sys
	Xfile line.  If its subscription list allows transmission of this news item,
	Xthen its command will be executed.
	XThis command may have up to two \*(lq%s\*(rq substitutions in it.
	XThe second of those is replaced by the name of a file
	Xcontaining the news item (used with the
	X.b U
	Xflag).
	XThe first is subjected to rather special treatment.
	XThe whole \*(lqword\*(rq (delimited by white space)
	Xcontaining that \*(lq%s\*(rq is duplicated as many times
	Xas there were systems with the
	X.b M
	Xflag set that referenced this multicast name
	X(which might be 0 times,
	Xcausing that \*(lqword\*(rq to be omitted).
	XIn each of these duplicates,
	Xthe \*(lq%s\*(rq is replaced by the name of a system.
	XNote the multicast system name itself is not included in this process.
	XThen the command is executed as usual.
	X.pg
	XThe second flag available if the news system is built with
	X.b MULTICAST
	Xdefined is
	X.b O .
	XIf this flag is set,
	Xthen the sys file line will be ignored unless the system name is
	Xa multicast name from some earlier line with the
	X.b M
	Xflag,
	Xand the news item is to be sent to that (earlier) system.
	XThis allows the subscription list for the multicast system name
	X(which is likely to be a fake system name,
	Xinvented just for this purpose)
	Xto be given a very wide subscription list
	X(like
	X.ng all )
	Xwithout any unusual effects.
	X.pg
	XHere is an example.
	XAssume that you wish to forward
	X.ng comp.unix
	Xto four people by mail.
	XYou could do this as ...
	X.si
	X.sd
	Xfred:comp.unix::mail fred
	Xharry:comp.unix::mail harry
	Xjane:comp.unix::mail jane
	Xtony:comp.unix::mail tony
	X.ed
	X.ei
	Xhowever this causes the mail program to be started 4 times,
	Xonce for each recipient.
	XOn some systems starting the mail program is a very expensive operation.
	XIf
	X.b MULTICAST 
	Xis defined,

	Xfred:comp.unix:M:tony
	Xharry:comp.unix:M:tony
	Xjane:comp.unix:M:tony
	Xtony:comp.unix::mail tony %s
	X.ed
	X.ei
	XThis would cause just one command to be run:
	X\*(lqmail tony fred harry jane\*(rq.
	XNote that \*(lqtony\*(rq must still be explicitly included in the argument
	Xlist to the mail command;
	Xthe \*(lq%s\*(rq does not expand to include
	Xthe multicast \*(lqsystem name\*(rq itself.
	X.pg
	XA more useful way of doing this,
	Xwhich does not assume that all the mail readers
	Xwill want to read the same newsgroups is as follows.
	X.si
	X.sd
	Xfred:comp.unix:M:Mail
	Xharry:sci.physics,sci.astro:M:Mail
	Xjane:comp.unix.wizards,soc.women:M:Mail
	Xtony:comp.unix,comp.unix.wizards,rec.humor:M:Mail
	XMail:all:O:mail %s
	X.ed
	X.ei
	X.pg
	XNow,
	Xif a news item in group
	X.ng comp.unix
	Xwas received,
	Xthe command
	X.sd c
	Xmail fred tony
	X.ed
	Xwould be executed.
	XIf the news were in both
	X.ng comp.unix
	Xand
	X.ng comp.unix.wizards
	Xthen the command would be
	X.sd c
	Xmail fred jane tony
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XIf a news item in
	X.ng sci.med
	X(which no-one gets by mail) arrives,
	Xthen the \*(lqMail\*(rq line will be ignored,
	Xbecause of the
	X.b O
	Xflag.
	X\*(lqMail\*(rq is a fake system invented just so its \*(lqtransfer command\*(rq
	Xcan be used to send news to the other recipients.
	X.pg
	XThe same kind of technique can be used for normal transfer
	Xof news to other systems if your transport network supports
	Xa facility to send to many other systems in one command.
	X(That is,
	Xif it has a multicast facility.)
	XSunIII (the network used in Australia) has this ability,
	Xso a typical Australian
	X.i sys
	Xfile looks like
	X.sd
	Xemuvax:world,aus,comp.sci:M:FakeName
	Xkremlin:world,aus,comp,sci:M:FakeName
	Xkanga:world,aus,comp.unix:M:FakeName
	XFakeName:all:OUS:/bin/sendfile -NRSareporter -d%s -x%s
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XA news item in
	X.ng aus.general
	Xcauses the following command
	X.sd c
	X/bin/sendfile -NRSareporter -demuvax -dkremlin -dkanga -x/usr/spool/...
	X.ed
	Xto be executed.
	XJust one command is run to send the news to three remote systems.
	X.pg
	XIf a multicast system has the
	X.b F
	Xflag set,
	Xthen the name of a file containing the news is appended to the file
	Xwhose name is in the fourth field,
	Xas usual.
	XBut on the same line,
	Xseparated by spaces,
	Xwill be appended the names of all the systems
	Xthat referenced this multicast system.
	X.pg
	XFor example,
	Xif the Australian site wanted to batch news,
	Xinstead of sending it directly,
	Xit would simply change the last line of its
	X.i sys
	Xfile to
	X.sd c
	XFakeName:all:F:/usr/spool/batched/allsites
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XThen a news item in
	X.ng misc.jobs
	Xwould cause the following line to be appended to
	X.i /usr/spool/batched/allsites
	X.sd c
	X/usr/spool/news/misc/jobs/5542 emuvax kremlin
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XThis can then be processed later, in something like the normal manner.
	X(Unfortunately no commands to do this processing are yet available.)
	X.pg
	XCaution: when
	X.b MULTICAST
	Xis defined,
	Xthe first \*(lq%s\*(rq in all transfer commands is used for multicast,
	Xregardless of whether or not the system name is ever used as the last field
	Xof some line with the
	X.b M
	Xflag set.
	XTo use the
	X.b U
	Xflag in such a case,
	Xa dummy \*(lq%s\*(rq should be used,
	Xit will simply be omitted from the command that is executed.
	X.pg
	XAs an example,
	Xif a
	X.i sys
	Xfile line without
	X.b MULTICAST
	Xdefined was:
	X.sd c
	Xfoovax:comp,world,na,usa:U:uux - foovax!foonews <%s
	X.ed
	Xwith
	X.b MULTICAST 
	Xdefined,
	Xit would need to be changed to:
	X.sd c
	Xfoovax:comp,world,na,usa:U:uux - foovax!foonews %s <%s
	X.ed
	X.pg
	XAdditional caution:
	XThe numbers of system names that may be used
	Xin this way are quite severly restricted.
	XTypically there may only be about 10 multicast system names,
	Xand each of those is restricted to sending to no more than about 20 systems.
	XThese limits are dynamic
	X(that is,
	Xthe numbers counted are the number of multicast systems
	Xreceiving any single news item,
	Xand the number of systems that each of those
	Xwill actually cause this particular news item to be sent to).
	XThese limits should easily suffice for real news sending to remote systems;

	XIntroduction
	X.pg
	XUSENET is a worldwide bulletin board system
	Xin which thousands of computers pass articles back and forth.
	XOf necessity,
	Xcustoms have sprung up enabling very diverse people and groups
	Xto communicate peaceably and effectively using USENET.
	XThese customs are for the most part written,
	Xbut are scattered over several documents
	Xthat can be difficult to find;
	Xin any case,
	Xeven if a new user can find all the documents,
	Xhe most likely will have neither the time nor the inclination
	Xto read them all.
	XThis document is intended to collect all these conventions into one place,
	Xthereby making it easy for new users
	Xto learn about the world of USENET.
	X(Old-timers,
	Xtoo,
	Xwill benefit from reading this.)
	X.pg
	XYou should read this document and understand it thoroughly
	Xbefore you even think about posting anything.
	XIf you have questions,
	Xplease ask your USENET administrator (who
	Xcan usually be reached by sending mail to
	X.i usenet )
	Xor a more knowledgeable USENET user.
	XBelieve me,
	Xyou will save yourself a lot of grief.
	X.pg
	XThe mechanics of posting an article to USENET are explained in
	XMark Horton's excellent paper
	X.i "How to Read the Network News" ;
	Xif you have not read that yet,
	Xstop here and do so.
	XA lot of what follows depends on your knowing (at least vaguely)
	Xthe mechanics of posting news.
	X.pg
	XBefore we discuss these customs,
	Xwe ought to look at the history of USENET,
	Xwhat it is today,
	Xand why we need these conventions.
	X.hn
	XAll About USENET
	X.pg
	XUSENET began on a set of computers in North Carolina's Research Triangle.
	XThe programs involved
	X(known as \*(lqnetnews\*(rq then,
	Xand \*(lqA news\*(rq now)
	Xexchanged messages;
	Xit was a small, multi-computer bulletin board system.
	XAs time passed,
	Xadministrators of other systems began to connect their computers
	Xto this bulletin board system.
	XThe network grew.
	XThen,
	Xat Berkeley, the news programs were rewritten
	X(this version became known as \*(lqB news\*(rq)
	Xand the format changed to conform to ARPA standards
	X(again,
	Xthis became the \*(lqB protocol for news\*(rq.\*(dg)
	X.fn
	X.lp \*(dg \w'\*(dg\ 'u
	XSee
	X.i
	XStandard for Interchange of USENET Messages
	X.r
	Xfor a description of the two formats.
	X.ef
	XThis version of news was very widely distributed,
	Xand at this point USENET began to take on its current shape.
	X.pg
	XUSENET is a
	X.i logical
	Xnetwork
	X(as opposed to a
	X.i physical
	Xnetwork.)
	XIt is also a very amorphous network,
	Xin that there is no central administration or controlling site.
	XThere is not even an official list of members,
	Xalthough there is a very complete unofficial one.
	XA site gets access to USENET by finding some other site already on USENET
	Xthat it can connect to and exchange news articles.
	XSo long as this second site (called a
	X.i neighbor
	Xof the first site)
	Xremains willing and able to pass articles to and from the first site,
	Xthe first site is on USENET.
	XA site leaves the USENET only when no one is willing or able
	Xto pass articles to,
	Xor accept articles from,
	Xit.
	X.pg
	XAs a result,
	XUSENET has no equivalent of a \*(lqsysop\*(rq
	Xor central authority controlling the bulletin board.
	XWhat little control is exercised is wielded by the person at each site
	Xwho is responsible for maintaining the USENET connecions
	X(this person is called the \*(lqUSENET administrator.\*(rq)
	XBecause most USENET administrators are (relatively) new to USENET,
	Xand because administering USENET locally involves a great deal of work,
	Xmost USENET administrators tend to follow the lead of other,
	Xmore experienced,
	Xadministrators
	X(often known somewhat irreverently as \*(lqnet gurus.\*(rq)
	XThis is not an abdication of responsibility,
	Xbut a means of keeping the amount of work little enough
	Xso it can be done without interfering with the local USENET administrator's job.
	XAn example of this is the list of currently active newsgroups
	Xcirculated every month or so.
	XIt is not \*(lqofficial\*(rq \-
	Xno one has that authority \-
	Xbut as the maintainer is doing the work that every other USENET administrator
	Xwould have to do otherwise,
	Xit is accepted as a valid list.
	XIf the maintainer changes the list in a way
	Xanother USENET administrator finds unacceptable,
	Xthat administrator can simply ignore the list.
	X(Incidentally, the \*(lqnet gurus\*(rq became known as such
	Xbecause of the work they have contributed to USENET.
	XTheir experience is a valuable resource for each USENET administrator.)
	X.pg
	XBecause the USENET has grown so wildly,
	Xa number of problems have appeared.
	XOne of these problems is technical,
	Xand a number of the conventions this document describes
	Xspring from attempts to keep this problem under control.
	X.pg
	XThe technical problem arises due to the transport mechanism used by most USENET sites.
	XMost computers on USENET do not have access to large-area networks like
	XARPANET.
	XAs a result the only viable transport mechanism these sites can use
	Xis a set of programs collectively known as UUCP
	Xand which communicate over dialup telephone lines.
	XInitially,
	Xnews programs generated one UUCP command per article.
	XWith the explosion of the USENET,
	Xthe number of articles simply swamped many sites;
	Xphone lines would be tied up all day transmitting news,
	Xand many articles would be processed at the same time,
	Xslowing down the computers noticeably.
	X.pg
	XThe solution was to batch messages.
	XThis way,
	Xmany articles are sent via UUCP with one command,
	Xand the command on the receiving machine would split the file
	Xinto separate articles,
	Xwhich could then be processed individually.
	XWhile this increased the size of the files being sent,
	Xit cut down on the number of UUCP commands sent,
	Xand since sending a command involves quite a bit of overhead,
	Xthis decreased the duration of phone calls,
	Xand to a lesser degree the load on the computer.
	XAt some sites,
	Xsuch as Purdue,
	Xthis was not quite enough,
	Xso a simple spooler was implemented to process the individual articles
	Xone at a time.
	XThis reduced the system load to a very acceptable amount.
	X.pg
	XHowever,
	Xthe problem has not gone away by any means.
	XIn one sense it has become worse;
	Xas more articles are posted to the network,
	Xphone costs and system loads averages increase,
	Xand system administrators require USENET administrators to cut back
	Xor eliminate newsgroups and
	Xto transmit news only at night
	X(which means long propagation delays).
	XIn short,
	Xeveryone who has anything to do with administering any USENET site
	Xis very concerned about the future of USENET,
	Xboth in general
	Xand at his own site.
	X.pg
	XMany of the rules you will read address this concern.
	XThe fear that USENET may collapse is not a bogeyman,
	Xbut very real.
	XWe hope it will not collapse,
	Xand the rules below outline some ways to prevent problems
	Xand increase the likelihood
	Xthat enough sites will remain on USENET to keep it alive.
	XThere is no central authority that can force you to follow them,
	Xbut by doing so you will help keep USENET a valuable resource
	Xto the computer community.
	X.hn
	XDeciding to Post
	X.pg
	XBefore you decide to post an article,
	Xyou should consider a few things.
	X.hn 2
	XDo not repeat postings
	X.pg
	XThis applies even if you did not post the information the first time around.
	XIf you know the answer to a question someone asked,
	Xfirst read the followups, and if you have something more to contribute,
	Xmail it to the questioner;
	Xif you think it should be seen by others,
	Xask the questioner to summarize the answers he receives in a subsequent article.
	XOne of the biggest problems on USENET is that
	Xmany copies of the same answer to a simple question are posted.
	X.pg
	XIf you want to repost something because you believe
	Xit did not get to other USENET sites due to transmission problems
	X(this happens sometimes,
	Xbut a lot less often than commonly believed),
	Xdo some checking before you repost.
	XIf you have a friend at another USENET site,
	Xcall him and ask if the article made it to his site.
	XAsk your USENET administrator if he knows of any problems in the USENET;
	Xthere are special newsgroups to which USENET administrators subscribe
	Xin which problems are reported,
	Xor he can contact his counterparts at other sites for information.
	XFinally,
	Xif you decide you must repost it,
	Xindicate in the article subject that it is a reposting,
	Xand say why you are reposting it
	X(if you don't,
	Xyou'll undoubtedly get some very nasty mail.)
	X.pg
	XReposting announcements of products or services is flatly forbidden.
	XDoing so may convince other sites to turn off your USENET access.
	X.pg
	XWhen school starts,
	Xhoards of new users descend upon the USENET
	Xasking questions.
	XMany of these questions have been asked,
	Xand answered,
	Xliterally thousands of times since USENET began.
	XThe most common of these questions,
	Xand their answers,
	Xhave been collected in the hope that
	Xthe new users will read them and not re-post the same questions.
	XSo,
	Xif you want to ask a question,
	Xcheck Appendix I
	X.b "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions" ) (
	Xto be sure it isn't one that has been asked and answered
	Xliterally hundreds of times before you started reading the USENET.
	X.hn 2
	XDo not post anything when upset, angry, or intoxicated
	X.pg
	XPosting an article is a lot like driving a car \-
	Xyou have to be in control of yourself.
	XPostings which begin \*(lqJane,
	Xyou ignorant slut, ...\*(rq
	Xare very definitely considered in poor taste\*(dg.
	X.fn
	X\*(dg Unless you are critiquing
	X.i "Saturday Night Live" .
	X.ef
	XUnfortunately,
	Xthey are also far too common.
	X.pg
	XThe psychology of this is interesting.
	XOne popular belief is that since we interact with USENET via computers,
	Xwe all often forget that a computer did not do the posting;
	Xa human did.
	XA contributing factor is that you don't have to look the target of abuse
	Xin the eye when you post an abusive message;
	Xeye-to-eye contact has an amazing effect on inhibiting obnoxious behavior.
	XAs a result,
	Xdiscussions on the USENET often degenerate into a catfight
	Xfar more readily than would a face-to-face discussion.
	X.pg
	XBefore you post an article,
	Xthink a minute;
	Xdecide whether or not you are upset,
	Xangry,
	Xor high.
	XIf you are,
	Xwait until you calm down (or come down) before deciding to post something.
	XThen think about whether or not you really want to post it.
	XYou will be amazed what waiting a day or even a few hours can do
	Xfor your perspective.
	X.pg
	XBear in mind that
	Xshouting hasn't convinced anyone of anything
	Xsince the days of Charlemagne,
	Xand being abusive makes people hold even more tenaciously
	Xto their ideas or opinions.
	XGentleness,
	Xcourtesy,
	Xand eloquence are far more persuasive;
	Xnot only do they indicate you have enough confidence in your words
	Xto allow them to speak for you,
	Xbut also they indicate a respect for your audience.
	XThis in turn makes it easier for your audience to like or respect you \-
	Xand people tend to be far more interested in,
	Xand receptive to,
	Xarguments advanced by those they like or respect
	Xthan by writers who are abusive.
	XFinally,
	Xremember that some discussions or situations simply cannot be resolved.
	XBecause people are different,
	Xagreed-upon facts often lead to wildly different feelings and conclusions.
	XThese differences are what makes life so wonderful;
	Xwere we all alike,
	Xthe world would be a very boring place.
	XSo,
	Xdon't get frantic;
	Xrelax and enjoy the discussion.
	XWho knows,
	Xyou might even learn something!
	X.hn 2
	XBe sure your posting is appropriate to USENET
	X.pg
	XSome things are inappropriate to post to USENET.
	XDiscussing whether or not some other discussion is appropriate,
	Xor if it is in the right newsgroup,
	Xis an example.
	XInvariably,
	Xthe \*(lqmeta-discussion\*(rq generates so many articles
	Xthat the discussion is simply overwhelmed and vanishes;
	Xbut the meta-discussion lingers on for several weeks,
	Xdriving most of the readers of that newsgroup
	Xout of their collective minds.
	XHelp preserve the sanity of your fellow USENET readers
	Xby mailing such comments to the people involved,
	Xrather than posting them.
	X.pg
	XAnother example of inappropriate postings is the infamous
	X\*(lqspelling flame.\*(rq
	XEvery few months someone takes another poster to task
	Xfor poor spelling or grammar.
	XSoon,
	Xeveryone jumps on the bandwagon,
	Xtearing apart one another's postings for such errors.
	XTo put it mildly,
	Xthis angers almost everyone involved
	Xfor no real reason.
	XPlease remember that we all make mistakes,
	Xand there are a lot of people for whom English is a second language.
	XSo,
	Xtry to keep your spelling and grammar comments to yourself \-
	Xbut if you find you simply cannot,
	Xmail them to the poster rather than posting them.
	X.pg
	XFar more insidious are requests similar to
	X\*(lqHow can I splice into the local cable TV transmission line?\*(rq
	XPosting to USENET is akin to publishing,
	Xso don't ask for or post instructions on how to do something illegal.
	XAnd please don't quote the First Amendment,
	Xor the laws allowing freedom of speech in your country;
	Xwhile the posting programs will not stop you,
	Xthe aftermath could be very unpleasant \-
	Xlawsuits and court trials usually are,
	Xand the USENET would certainly collapse as sites dropped from it
	Xto protect themselves from legal liability.
	XYou wouldn't want that on your conscience,
	Xwould you?
	XOf course not.
	X.pg
	XRelated to this is the next rule.
	X.hn 2
	XDo not post other people's work without permission
	X.pg
	XPosting something to USENET puts it in the public domain
	Xfor all practical purposes.
	XSo,
	Xbe careful about posting things like
	X.ux -related
	Xmaterial (specifically source code) or company documents;
	Xconsider licensing and nondisclosure agreements first. Some people regard
	Xthe posting of  \*(lqdiffs\*(rq based on licensed code to be a suitable
	Xcompromise, as they are only useful to those who have the base code already.
	X.pg
	XCopyrighted works are a separate problem.
	XBoth United States and international law provide protection
	Xfor copyrighted works;
	Xother than short extracts for purposes of criticism,
	Xyou cannot copy a copyrighted work in whole or in part
	Xwithout permission of the copyright holder
	X(who may,
	Xor may not,
	Xbe the author.)
	XWithout this protection,
	Xartists could not make any money and hence would have limited incentive
	Xto make the fruits of their art available at all.
	XPosting a copyrighted work without permission is theft,
	Xeven though the property stolen is not tangible in most cases.
	XHence,
	Xposting movie and book reviews,
	Xsong lyrics,
	Xor anything else which is copyrighted
	Xwithout the permission of the copyright holder,
	Xcould cause you personally,
	Xyour company,
	Xor the USENET itself
	Xto be held liable for damages.
	XPlease be very careful that you obey the law
	Xwhen posting such material!
	X.hn 2
	XDon't forget that opinions are those of the poster and not his employer.
	X.pg
	XEvery so often,
	Xsomeone will post a particularly disgusting article,
	Xand a number of responses will ask
	Xif all employees of the original poster's company
	Xshare his (revolting) opinion,
	Xor suggest that action be taken against that company.
	XPlease remember that all opinions or statements in articles
	Xare to be attributed to the poster
	X.i only ,
	Xand in particular, do not necessarily represent the opinions
	Xof the poster's employer,
	Xthe owner of the computer on which the article originated,
	Xor anyone involved with any aspect of USENET \-
	Xand consequently the responsibility for any USENET message
	Xrests with the poster and with no one else.
	XThe appropriate response is not to attack the company
	Xor its other employees;
	Xlet the poster know what you think of his posting via mail.
	XIf the postings continue,
	Xtake advantage of the news software's presenting you
	Xwith the author's name and the subject line
	Xand then asking if you want to see the article;
	Xstart looking for the poster's name or the offensive subject
	Xin the articles presented to you
	Xand skip them. If you really get offended, you can unsubscribe from a newsgroup.
	X.pg
	XPart of the price of freedom is allowing others to make fools of themselves.
	XYou wouldn't like to be censored,
	Xso don't advocate censorship of others.
	XNo one is forcing you to read the postings.
	X.pg
	XIn some countries,
	Xposting or receiving certain types of articles may be a criminal offense.
	XAs a result,
	Xcertain newsgroups which circulate freely within the United States
	Xmay not be circulated in other nations
	Xwithout risking civil or criminal liabilities.
	XIn this case,
	Xthe appropriate action for sites in that country
	Xis neither to accept nor to transmit the newsgroup.
	XNo site is
	X.i ever
	Xforced to accept or pass on
	X.i any
	Xnewsgroup.
	X.hn 1
	XWhere to Post
	X.pg
	XThe various newsgroups and distributions
	Xhave various rules associated with their use.
	XThis section will describe these rules
	Xand offer suggestions on which newsgroups to post your message.
	X.hn 2
	XKeep the distribution as limited as possible
	X.pg
	XA basic principle of posting is to keep the distribution of your article
	Xas limited as possible.
	XLike our modern society,
	XUSENET is suffering from both an information glut and information pollution.
	XIt is widely believed that the USENET will cease to function
	Xunless we are able to cut down the quantity of articles.
	XOne step in this direction is not to post something to places
	Xwhere it will be worthless.
	XFor example,
	Xif you live in Hackensack,
	XNew Jersey,
	Xthe probability of anyone in Korea wanting to buy your
	X1972 Toyota is about as close to zero as you can get.
	XSo confine your posting to the New Jersey area.
	X.pg
	XTo do this,
	Xyou can either post to a local group, 
	Xor post to a net-wide group and use the
	X.i distribution
	Xfeature to limit how widely your article will go.
	XWhen you give your posting program
	X(usually
	X.i postnews (1))
	Xa distribution,
	Xyou are (in essence) saying that
	Xmachines which do not recognize that distribution
	Xshould not get the article.
	X(Think of it as a subgroup based on locality and you'll get the idea.)
	XFor example,
	Xif you are posting in the San Francisco Bay Area,
	Xand you post your article to
	X.ng rec.auto
	Xbut give
	X.ng ba
	Xas the distribution,
	Xthe article will not be sent beyond the San Francisco Bay Area
	X(to which the
	X.ng ba
	Xdistribution is local)
	Xeven though you put it in a net-wide newsgroup.
	XHad you given the distribution as
	X.ng ca
	X(the California distribution),
	Xyour article would have been sent to all Californian sites on USENET.
	XHad you given the distribution as
	X.ng world ,
	Xyour article would have been sent to all sites on USENET.
	X.hn 2
	XDo not post the same article twice to different groups
	X.pg
	XIf you have an article that you want to post to more than one group,
	Xpost to both at the same time.
	XNewer versions of the news software will show an article only once
	Xregardless of how many newsgroups it appears in.
	XBut if you post it once to each different group,
	Xall versions of news software will show it once for each newsgroup.
	XThis angers a lot of people
	Xand wastes everybody's time.
	X.hn 2
	XDo not post to moderated newsgroups.
	X.pg
	XYou may not post directly to certain newsgroups;
	Xyou cannot post to some at all.
	XNewer versions of the news software will inform you
	Xwhen either of these restrictions apply,
	Xbut older versions of news software will not.
	X.pg
	XIf you want to have the appropriate moderator post something,
	Xmail it to the moderator.
	X(If you do not know the address,
	Xask your USENET administrator.
	XIn some cases,
	Xthe software will automatically mail,
	Xrather than post,
	Xyour article to the moderator.)
	X.hn 2
	XAsk someone if you can't figure out where to post your article
	X.pg
	XIf you cannot figure out where to post something,
	Xlook in
	X.ng news.announce.newusers
	Xfor the list of active newsgroups.
	X(This is posted biweekly.
	XIf you can't find it,
	Xlook at the list in
	X.i "How to Read the Network News" ;
	Xbut be aware that list is undoubtedly out of date already.)
	XIf your article does not seem to fit in any of the listed groups,
	Xpost it to
	X.ng misc.misc
	Xor don't post it.
	X.pg
	XIf you still are not sure which newsgroup to post your article to,
	Xask an old-timer.
	XIf your site doesn't have any old-timers
	X(or none of the old-timers will admit to being old-timers),
	Xcontact any of the following people:
	X.sd
	XGene Spafford (spaf@gatech.CSNET, spaf@gatech.UUCP)
	XMark Horton (mark@cbosgd.UUCP)
	XRick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV, rick@seismo.UUCP)
	XChuq Von Rospach (chuq@sun.UUCP)
	XMatt Bishop (mab@riacs.ARPA, mab@riacs.UUCP)
	X.ed
	XWe will be happy to help you.
	XBut,
	Xplease,
	Xdo not post the article to the net before you ask us!
	X.hn 2
	XBe sure there is a consensus before creating a new newsgroup
	X.pg
	XCreating a new newsgroup is,
	Xin general,
	Xa very bad idea.
	XCurrently,
	Xthere are so many articles being posted that the USENET is in dange of collapse
	Xas site after site decides to cease to accept and retransmit certain newsgroups.
	XMoreover,
	Xthere is no established procedure for deleting a newsgroup,
	Xso once created,
	Xnewsgroups tend to stay around.
	XThey also tend to encourage people to think up new newsgroups,
	Xand the cycle repeats.
	XTry to avoid thinking up new newsgroups.
	X.pg
	XIf,
	Xhowever,
	Xyou believe a new group should be created,
	Xbe sure you have a consensus that the group is needed
	X(either a mailing list has enough traffic and readers
	Xto justify turning it into a newsgroup,
	Xor a discussion in a current newsgroup
	Xbecomes so large for a period of time long enough
	Xto warrant splitting it into a newsgroup.)
	XThen post an article to
	X.ng news.group
	Xas well as any other groups related to your proposed new group,
	Xand discuss the topics you are proposing be covered in your new group,
	Xwhat it should be called,
	Xwhether it is
	X.i really
	Xneeded,
	Xand so forth.
	XTry to resolve all objections,
	Xand take into account all suggestions and comments;
	Xfinally,
	Xhave everyone mail you a \*(lqyes\*(rq or \*(lqno\*(rq vote
	Xon whether the group should be created.
	XTry to get at least 40 or 50 \*(lqyes\*(rq votes before creating the group;
	Xif you want to be safe,
	Xget around 100.
	X.hn 2
	XWatch out for newsgroups which have special rules about posting
	X.pg
	XSome newsgroups have special rules.
	XThis section summarizes them.
	X.lp rec.arts.books 20
	XDo not post anything revealing a plot or a plot twist
	Xwithout putting the word
	X.cf spoiler
	Xsomewhere in the
	X.hf Subject
	Xfield.
	XThis will let those who do not wish to have a surprise spoiled
	Xskip the article.
	X.lp rec.humor 20
	XIf you want to post an offensive joke
	X(this includes racial,
	Xreligious,
	Xsexual,
	Xand scatalogical humor,
	Xamong other kinds)
	Xrotate it.
	X(If you do not know what this means,
	Xlook in the section

	X.lp rec.arts.movies 20
	XDo not post anything revealing a plot or a plot twist
	Xwithout putting the word

	X.hn 1
	XWriting the Article
	X.pg
	XHere are some suggestions to help you communicate effectively
	Xwith others on the USENET.
	XPerhaps the best advice is not to be afraid to consult a book on
	Xwriting style;
	Xtwo of the best are
	X.i "How to Write for the World of Work"
	Xby Cunningham and Pearsall,
	Xand
	X.i "Elements of Style"
	Xby Strunk and White.
	X.hn 2
	XWrite for your audience
	X.pg
	XUSENET is an international network,
	Xand any article you post will be
	X.i very
	Xwidely read.
	XEven more importantly,
	Xyour future employers may be among the readers!
	XSo,
	Xtry to make a good impression.
	X.pg
	XA basic principle of all writing is to write at your readers' reading level.
	XIt is better to go below than above.
	XAiming where \*(lqtheir heads ought to be\*(rq may be fine
	Xif you are a college professor (and a lot of us would dispute even that),
	Xbut it is guaranteed to cause people to ignore your article.
	XStudies have shown that the average American reads at the fifth grade level
	Xand the average professional reads at the twelfth grade level.
	X.hn 2
	XBe clear and concise
	X.pg
	XRemember that you are writing for a very busy audience;
	Xyour readers will not puzzle over your article.
	XSo be very clear and very concise.
	XBe precise as well;
	Xchoose the least ambiguous word you can,
	Xtaking into account the context in which you are using the word.
	XSplit your posting into sections and paragraphs as appropriate.
	XUse a descriptive title in the
	X.hf Subject
	Xfield,
	Xand be sure that the title is related to the body of the article.
	XIf the title is not related,
	Xfeel free to change it to a title that is.
	X.hn 2
	XProofread your article
	X.pg
	XThis is a matter of courtesy;
	Xsince you want others to read your article,
	Xthe least you can do is check that it says what you mean in a clear,
	Xconcise manner.
	XCheck for typographical errors,
	Xsilly grammar errors,
	Xand misspellings;
	Xif you have a spelling checking program,
	Xuse it.
	XAlso be sure the article is easy to read.
	XUse white space \- blanks, tabs, and newlines \-
	Xand both upper and lower case letters.
	XDo not omit the definite and indefinite articles,
	Xeither;
	Xnot only do \*(lqa\*(rq,
	X\*(lqan\*(rq,
	Xand \*(lqthe\*(rq make a posting much easier to read,
	Xtheir omission can make a posting ambiguous.
	X.hn 2
	XBe extra careful with announcements of products or services
	X.pg
	XWhen writing a product or service announcement,
	Xbear in mind that others will be paying most of the telephone bills.
	XSo,
	Xif you are announcing several things,
	Xcombine all the announcements into one article.
	XMark the posting as a product or service announcement
	Xin the title in the
	X.hf Subject
	Xfield.
	XAdvertising hyperbole is not appropriate here;
	Xremember that your audience is to a large degree technically literate,
	Xand your product will stand or fall on its technical merits.
	XBe aware that posting obnoxious or inappropriate advertisements
	Xis very serious and if you do it,
	Xyou may find your neighbors yanking your USENET access.
	X.hn 2
	XIndicate sarcasm and humor
	X.pg
	XRemember that people cannot see you when they read your posting;
	Xhence,
	Xall the subtle nuances of body and facial motion are hidden.
	XIt can be quite difficult to tell when you are being sarcastic or humorous.
	XTo deal with this problem,
	Xthe USENET readers and posters have developed a special sign.
	XMark passages you intend to be taken as humorous with the
	X\*(lqsmiley face\*(rq,
	Xwhile looks like this: \*(lq:\-)\*(rq.
	X(Think of a head facing you lying on its right side and look again
	Xif you don't understand why that symbol was chosen.)
	XAs for sarcasm,
	Xthere is no universal symbol for that
	X(unless the sarcasm is meant humorously,
	Xin which case use the smiley face again.)
	XBut mark your passage so everyone will realize you are being sarcastic.
	X.hn 2
	XMark postings which spoil surprises
	X.pg
	XHigh on the list of obnoxious messages
	Xare those that spoil the plot of a book or movie
	Xby giving away an unexpected detail.
	XIf you post such an article,
	Xplease put the word
	X.cf spoiler
	Xin the
	X.hf Subject
	Xfield of your posting,
	Xso people who do not wish to have a surprise ruined can skip the article.
	X.hn 2
	XRotate offensive postings
	X.pg
	XIf you feel you must post a message that may offend people,
	Xyou can do one of two things.
	XYou can post it to the newsgroup
	X.ng talk.flame
	Xor you can take steps to be sure the message will only be read
	Xby those who explicitly ask for it to be shown to them.
	XIn the latter case,
	Xthe USENET convention is to encrypt these messages
	Xby shifting each letter 13 characters,
	Xso that
	X(for example)
	X\*(lqa\*(rq becomes \*(lqn\*(rq.
	X(In more precise terms,
	Xthis is a Caesar cipher of shift 13;
	Xon the USENET,
	Xit is called
	X.i rot13 .)
	XWhen you do this,
	Xput the word
	X.cf rot13
	Xin the
	X.hf Subject
	Xfield.
	XThe news reader you are using almost certainly has a command
	Xto encrypt and decrypt such messages;
	Xif not,
	Xuse the
	X.ux
	Xcommand
	X.sd c
	Xtr a\-zA\-Z n\-za\-mN\-ZA\-M
	X.ed
	X.hn 2
	XThe shorter your signature, the better
	X.pg
	XKeep signatures concise;
	X2 or 3 lines are usually plenty.
	XInclude your name and addresses on any major networks
	X(such as ARPANET,
	XBITNET,
	Xor CSNET).
	XThis helps people contact you quickly and easily,
	Xusually more so than by following the return path of the article.
	XDo not include pictures, graphics or clever quotations that make the
	Xsignature longer; this is not the appropriate place for them,
	Xand many sites resent paying the phone bills for such signatures.

	XIs a machine at \*(lqfoo\*(rq on the net?
	X.Lp
	XThese questions belong in
	X.ng news.config
	Xif anywhere,
	Xbut in fact your best bet is usually to phone somebody
	Xat \*(lqfoo\*(rq to find out.
	XIf you don't know anybody at \*(lqfoo\*(rq you can always try calling
	Xand asking for the \*(lqcomputer center.\*(rq
	XAlso,
	Xsee the newsgroup
	X.ng mod.map ,
	Xwhere maps of USENET and the UUCP network are posted regularly.
	X.Lp \04.
	XWhat does \*(lqrc\*(rq at the end of files like
	X.i .newsrc
	Xmean?
	X.Lp
	XAccording to Dennis Ritchie,
	X\*(lqThe name
	X.i rc
	Xcomes from RUNCOM, which was the rough equivalent
	Xon the MIT CTSS system of what
	X.ux
	Xcalls shell scripts.  Of course,
	XRUNCOM derives from 
	X.i "run commands.\*(rq"
	X.Lp \05.
	XWhat do \*(lq- (nf)\*(rq and \*(lqOrphaned Response\*(rq in an item's title mean?
	X.Lp
	XIt means that the item was created by \*(lqnotefiles,\*(rq
	Xan alternative news handling interface that many people prefer.
	XIf you want to find out more you can read the
	X.i \*(lqNotesfile
	XSystem Reference Manual\*(rq or contact
	X.cn uiucdcs!essick .
	X.Lp \06.
	XWhat does \*(lq:\-)\*(rq mean?
	X.Lp
	XThis is the net convention for a \*(lqsmiley face.\*(rq
	XIt means that something is being said in jest.
	XIf it doesn't look like a smiley face to you,
	Xflop your head over to the left and look again.
	X.Lp \07.
	XHow do I decrypt jokes in
	X.ng rec.humor ?
	X.Lp
	XThe standard cipher used in
	X.ng rec.humor
	Xin called \*(lqrot13.\*(rq
	XEach letter is replaced by the letter 13 further along in the alphabet
	X(cycling around at the end).
	XMost systems have a built in command to decrypt such articles;
	X.i readnews (1)
	Xand
	X.i vnews (1)
	Xhave the
	X.qp D
	Xcommand,
	X.i rn (1)
	X(another popular public-domain full screen news reader) has the
	X.qp X
	Xor
	X.qc CONTROL-X
	Xcommands,
	X.i notes (1)
	Xhas
	X.qp %
	Xor
	X.qp R .
	XIf your system doesn't have a program to encrypt and decrypt these,
	Xyou can quickly create a shell script using
	X.i tr (1):
	X.sd c
	Xtr A\-Za\-z N\-ZA\-Mn\-za\-m
	X.ed
	XOn some versions of
	X.ux ,
	Xthe
	X.i tr
	Xcommand should be written as:
	X.sd c
	Xtr \*(lq[a\-m][n\-z][A\-M][N\-Z]\*(rq \*(lq[n\-z][a\-m][N\-Z][A\-M]\*(rq
	X.ed

	X.ng soc.net-people :
	XIs John Doe out there anywhere?
	X.Lp
	XI suspect that these items are people looking for freshman roommates
	Xthat they haven't seen in ten years.
	XIf you have some idea where the person is
	Xyou are usually better off calling the organization.
	XFor example,
	Xif you call any Bell Labs location and request John Doe's number.
	XThey can give it to you even if he works at a different location.
	X.Lp \09.
	X.ng sci.math :
	XProofs that 1 \(eq 0.
	X.Lp
	XAlmost everyone has seen one or more of these in high school.
	XThey are almost always based on either division by 0
	Xor taking the square root of a negative number.
	X.Lp 10.
	X.ng rec.games :
	XWhere can I get the source for
	X.i empire (6)
	Xor
	X.i rogue (6)?
	X.Lp
	XYou can't.
	XThe authors of these games,
	Xas is their right,
	Xhave chosen not to make the sources available.
	X.Lp 11.
	X.ng comp.unix.wizards :
	XHow do I remove files with
	X.sm ASCII "" non-
	Xcharacters in their names?
	X.Lp
	XYou can try to find a pattern that uniquely identifies the file.
	XThis sometimes fails because a peculiarity of some shells is that
	Xthey strip off the high-order bit of characters in command lines.
	XNext,
	Xyou can try an \*(lqrm \-i\*(rq, or \*(lqrm \-r\*(rq
	X(see
	X.i rm (1).)
	XFinally,
	Xyou can mess around with i-node numbers and
	X.i find (1).
	X.Lp 12.
	X.ng comp.unix.wizards :
	XThere is a bug in the way
	X.ux
	Xhandles protection for programs that run setuid.
	X.Lp
	XThere are indeed problems with the treatment of protection in setuid programs.
	XWhen this is brought up,
	Xsuggestions for changes range from implementing a full capability list
	Xarrangement to new kernel calls for allowing more control over when
	Xthe effective id is used and when the real id is used to control accesses.
	XSooner or later you can expect this to be improved.
	XFor now you just have to live with it.
	X.Lp 13.
	X.ng soc.women :
	XWhat do you think about abortion?
	X.Lp
	XAlthough abortion might appear to be an appropriate topic for
	X.ng soc.women ,
	Xmore heat than light is generated when it is brought up.
	XSince the newsgroup
	X.ng talk.abortion
	Xhas been created,
	Xall abortion-related discussion should take place there.

	XHow do I use the
	X.hf Distribution
	Xfeature?
	X.Lp
	XWhen
	X.i postnews (1)
	Xprompts you for a distribution,
	Xit's asking how widely distributed you want your article.
	XThe set of possible replies is different,
	Xdepending on where you are,
	Xbut at Bell Labs in Murray Hill,
	XNew Jersey,
	Xpossibilities include:
	X.sd c
	X\!.ta 8n
	Xmh3bc1\tlocal to this machine

	X.ed
	XIf you hit

	Xyou'll get the default,

	XThis default is often not appropriate \-
	X.i please
	Xtake a moment to think about how far away people are likely
	Xto be interested in what you have to say.
	XUsed car ads,
	Xhousing wanted ads,
	Xand things for sale other than specialized equipment like computers
	Xcertainly shouldn't be distributed to Europe and Korea,
	Xor even to the next state.
	X.Lp
	XThe newsgroup
	X.ng misc.forsale
	Xexists for postings of sale announcements.
	XIts distribution is limited to North America;
	Xposters should restrict this distribution even further,
	Xif possible and appropriate.
	X.Lp 16.
	XWhy do some people put funny lines
	X(\*(lqbug killers\*(rq)
	Xat the beginning of their articles?
	X.Lp
	XSome earlier versions of news had a bug which would drop
	Xthe first 512 or 1024 bytes of text of certain articles.
	XThe bug was triggered whenever the article started with whitespace
	X(a blank or a tab).
	XA fix many people adopted was to begin their articles
	Xwith a line containing a character other than white space.
	XThis gradually evolved into the habit of including amusing first lines.
	X.Lp
	XThe original bug has since been fixed in newer version of news,
	Xand sites running older versions of news have applied a patch
	Xto prevent articles from losing text.
	XThe \*(lqbug-killer\*(rq lines are therefore probably no longer needed,
	Xbut they linger on.
	X.Lp 17.
	XWhat is the address or phone number of the \*(lqfoo\*(rq company?
	X.Lp
	XTry the white and yellow pages of your phone directory,
	Xfirst;
	Xa sales representative will surely know,
	Xand if you're a potential customer they will be who you're looking for.
	XPhone books for other cities are usually available in libraries of any size.
	XWhoever buys or recommends things for your company
	Xwill probably have some buyer's guides or national company directories.
	XCall or visit the reference desk of your library;
	Xthey have several company and organization directories
	Xand many will answer questions like this over the phone.
	XRemember if you only know the city where the company is,
	Xyou can telephone to find out their full address or a dealer.
	XThe network is
	X.i not
	Xa free resource,
	Xalthough it may look like that to some people.
	XIt is far better to spend a few minutes of your own time
	Xresearching an answer rather than broadcast
	Xyour laziness and/or ineptitude to the net.

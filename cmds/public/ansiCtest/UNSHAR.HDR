Archive-name: config2

This is a new version of a program that I started writing a few years
ago to automatically configure a large software system to the machine
it was to run on. Earlier versions of the program were also
distributed to the net.

The program tells you about lots of properties of your machine and C
compiler, and this version optionally produces the ANSI C float.h and
limits.h files. It also pinpoints some possible faults in your
compiler, and offers the option of verifying that the compiler is
correctly able to read the header files.

		Taskforce Test Suite
		====================

The following jobs remain to be done:

 1) checking the test suite in a Tiny Helios environment.
 2) add support for heterogenous networks, e.g. mixed T4/T8,
    mainly to check the processor facility of the CDL compiler
    and the relevant part of the TFM's mapping algorithm.
 3) add support for memory sizes. This will have to wait until I finally
    figure out exactly what memory requirements in a CDL script mean.
 4) run taskforces written in languages other than C. In particular,
    Fortran taskforces should be checked.
 5) n-dimensional grids ? 
 6) check the result of the CDL compiler, to determine whether or not
    the taskforce actually ran successfully.

Required from ABC:
	Disc change line hardware + support in the driver
	Hard disc hardware + driver
	The driver needs to be re-initialisable when the disc density changes.
	Optimal values for interleave and skew.

	It's probably best if I talk to Brian directly about these.

This directory contains the code for the Helios MSDOS File Server. The current
code is Version 1.0 Alpha and is not complete !!

The files are as follows :

	data.c		- global data
	dir.c		- directory handling routines
	fat.c		- FAT handling routines
	makefile*	- guess what ?
	misc.c		- routines I couldn't be bothered to classify
			  (file create, delete, getsize, etc.)
	msdosfs.c	- main + GSP + GSP functions
	msdosfs.h	- header  !
	msfloppy.c	- format and check disk frontend
	path.c		- pathname routines
	prototype.h	- function prototypes
	read.c		- disc read routines
	write.c		- disc write routines

I only ran the code on the prototype hardware for the first time today
(28/3/91) - all the development was done on a simulator. There are, therefore,
likely to be some bugs that I haven't yet discovered.

Bugs found so far :

	1. concurrent access to the disc appears to need checking
	   - the command cp *.h /dos & ; cp *.c /dos & ; repeat 20 ls -l /dos
	     produced a mangled block in one of the files.


Still to do :

	1. Disc change line (ABC to do)
	2. High Density discs (current code assumes 720K)
	3. Disc type calculation on startup
	4. Completion of CHKDSK routine (misc.c)
	5. Performance Optimisation.
	

To run the dos server, type

	/files/helios/lib/dos [servername] &

default servername is /dos.

Once msdosfs is running the server is accessed as /servername (default /dos).

To format a disc, run the server, insert a properly formatted 720K dos disc
then type "msfloppy -f", and put the disc to be formatted into the drive.

In this test version, the server requires a valid DOS disc to be in the drive
when it is first accessed !!.

The CHKDSK part will be performed by:

	msfloppy -c

Only the FAT's are check at present.

I have already encountered the old chestnut that discs formatted on other
drives do not read/write reliably on our drive. Discs formatted on our drive
give no problems.

If you find any more bugs, let me know !!

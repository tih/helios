Microlink digitiser format
==========================
This document describes the currentlt chosen format of the microlink event
  packets sent by the microcontroller which contain digitiser data. These
  events have type-symbol MLEstylu (re. Brian's document about the microlink
  protocol). The packet sent will be an extended-format packet so the first
  two bytes will consist of one byte for the header and another byte for
  the true length of the packet (as specified in Brian's document). The
  remainder of the packet forms the message-proper. The bytes in the
  remainder of the packet shall be organised as follows:
  
  1. The value 0   if the packet contains x-wire information.
     The value 255 if the packet contains y-wire information.
  2. Five bytes consisting of the wire values w1 to w5.
  3. One byte indicating the coarse position, or -1 to indicate
     'out of proximity'
  4. One byte to indicate the button status as follows:
     bit 0 : Left  hand button on FP PCB
     bit 1 : Middle     button on FP PCB
     bit 2 : Right hand button on FP PCB
     bit 3 : Barrel     button
     bit 4 : Tip        button
     bit 5 : Don't care
     bit 6 : Don't care
     bit 7 : Don't care
   5. That's it

This protocol is simply the serial protocol recently used between Paul and
   John except for the fact that the serial phasing header byte has been
   eliminated and replaced by the normal microlink header bytes.

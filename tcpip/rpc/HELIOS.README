The programs and libraries in here are currently compiled with their original
makefiles on Helios only. There is no support for cross-compilation or for
the Helios make system.

To build either see NHG, or copy this directory tree to a helios world and
go 'make' in rpc and rpcgen. If you want portmap and rpcinfo, go 'make' in
etc.

# This file contains netdevice entries for the supplied ethernet devices.
# It needs gdi V1.2 or later (which is distributed with the V1.2.1 upgrade).
#
# Either compile this file as follows:
#	gdi /helios/etc/devinfo.net /helios/etc/devinfo
#
# OR, if you have the file system, add the required netdevice definition to
# your existing devinfo.src and recompile it.


netdevice pc-ether
{
	device		pc-ether.d		# name of driver code in /helios/lib
}

netdevice sq-ether
{
	device		sq-ether.d		# name of driver code in /helios/lib
}

netdevice in-ether
{
	device		in-ether.d		# name of driver code in /helios/lib
	controller	3			# link to B407
	address		12.34.56.78.90.12	# ethernet address

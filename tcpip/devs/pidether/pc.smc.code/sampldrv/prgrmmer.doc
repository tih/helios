I/O DEFINITIONS

Western Digital Ethernet adapters use 32 I/O registers.
The first 8 registers are used for configuration.  The
second 8 registers are referred to as the LAN Address ROM.
They contain the adapters network address, an information
byte about the adapter and a check sum byte for these 08 hex
registers.  The last 16 bytes are mapped to the Network
Interface Controller (NIC). (Refer to DP8390C specifications).


CONFIGURATION REGISTERS

The definitions of the Configuration Registers vary from 
adapter to adapter.  Common to all adapters, however, is
the definition of I/O offset 00 hex.  This register controls
the shared RAM on the adapter and makes it possible for the 
software to give the NIC a hard reset.

The bit definitions for the Memory Select Register (MSR) are:

     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
    RST   MEN   A18   A17   A16   A15   A14   A13

RST resets the NIC and must be toggled.  MEN enables
the memory at the address defined by A18-A13. Note that most
Western Digital adapters assume A19 to be high or active, 
which means that the RAM is confined to the address space from
0x80000 to 0xFE000, except for the Micro Channel boards. The
range of RAM addresses is C0000h to DFFFFh.  The 8013EP/A
and 8013WP/A boards also have an additional bit defined to map
the shared RAM from FC0000h to FDFFFFh.  (Refer to the WD83C594
data sheet for further details.)  Bits 5 through 0 are not used
on the Micro Channel boards.  The RAM address is programmed in 
POS for these boards.

The rest of the registers vary from adapter to adapter:

     8003E, 8003EBT, 8003S, 8003SH, 8003WT
     I/O offset 0x01 through 0x07 are not used.  When
     read, they alias the 0x08 bytes of LAN Address ROM.
     When written, they alias to the MSR (offset 0x00).

     8003ET/A, 8003E/A, 8003ST/A, 8003W/A, 8013EP/A, 8013WP/A
     Refer to MICRO_CH.H found in the INCLUDE directory 
     of the Sample Driver diskette.

     8013EBT
     Refer to DEFS8013.H found in the INCLUDE directory 
     of the Sample Driver diskette.

     8003EB, 8003EP, 8003W
     Refer to DEFS583.H found in the INCLUDE directory 
     of the Sample Driver diskette.

     8013EP, 8013W, 8013EW
     Refer to DEFS583.H and DEFS8013.H found in the 
     INCLUDE directory of the Sample Driver diskette.


LAN ADDRESS ROM REGISTERS

I/O offsets 0x08 through 0x0D contain the unique six (6) 
byte Ethernet network address for this adapter.  I/O
offset 0x0E contains the ID byte for this adapter.  To
utilize the ID byte feature, it is recommended that the
programmer integrate GETCNFG code into the software driver.
This code is supplied in the SAMPLDRV directory on the
Sample Driver diskette.  Use CGETCNFG.ASM for C language
versions.  Finally, I/O offset 0x0F contains a check sum
byte for the LAN Address ROM.  The least significant byte
of the sum of all eight (8) LAN Address ROM bytes must
equal 0xFF.

NETWORK INTERFACE CONTROLLER (NIC) REGISTERS

For information on the NIC Registers, refer to the include
file DEFS8390.H found in the INCLUDE directory of the Sample
Driver diskette.  The National Semiconductor DP8390C
specification is a recommended reference.

     
BASIC OPERATIONS OF A LAN ADAPTER DRIVER

In general, a LAN adapter driver consists of three main parts,
with a fourth included in some applications.  

First, is the initialization code.  This should prepare the 
adapter for transmit and receive on the network and make all 
appropriate operating system calls to register the driver and 
adapter components.  For instance, in OS/2 the Shared RAM 
segment address must be registered with the operating system 
before any read/write operations are allowed.

Second, a transmit routine  responsible for putting a Media 
Access Control (MAC) frame on the network media must be provided. 

Third, an interrupt service routine must be provided.  During
the receive part of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), the 
driver requests memory from upper layer resources into which 
the received packet is copied.  Optionally, the driver may 
provide a means to dynamically change the state of the 
Driver/Adapter combination.  For instance, the upper layer 
software may need to enable a certain Multicast Address after 
initialization is complete.

The ISR may be found in the NSTK_CHK.C file in the DIAG 
directory of the Sample Driver diskette.  The routine is 
called "LAN_SERVICE_RTN".  It is called from the assembly 
module REAL_INT.ASM found in the ASMTOOLS directory of the 
Sample Driver diskette.

Other commonly used routines are contained in the files
SR_TOOLS.C and DM_TOOLS.C in the DIAG directory of the 
Sample Driver diskette.

The Transmit routine "TRANSMIT_PACKET" is found in SR_TOOLS.C, 
and takes a pointer to the Media Access Control (MAC) frame 
and the frames length.

The important Initialization routines include "SETUP_INT_VECTOR",
"GET_LAN_ADDR", "SETUP_8013", "ENABLE_BOARD_INT", "INIT_NIC",
"INITIALIZE_POINTERS" and "BOARD_INT_ON".

The routines "DISABLE_MULTICAST" and "ENABLE_MULTICAST", use a
predefined multicast address.  For general multicast usage, 
set the Accept Multicast (AM) bit in the Receive Configuration 
Register (RCR) and set the appropriate hash bit in the Multicast 
Address Registers (MAR) (or set them all for a quick and convenient 
solution).  Finally, because the hash does not uniquely identify 
all multicast addresses, make sure that a received multicast 
packet is correct.


The following summarizes the programming differences between
the adapters within the 8003 family.

     8003E, 8003EBT, 8003S, 8003SH, 8003WT (8-bit)
     These are the originals within the family.  When writing 
     the driver, take note of the register aliasing mentioned 
     in the Configuration Registers section.  Programming the 
     MSR is the only useful I/O other than the NIC registers.  
     RAM is 8 bits wide.

     8003ET/A, 8003E/A, 8003ST/A, 8003W/A (16-bit MCA)
     These are the Micro Channel Adapters (MCA).  The config-
     uration information may be read from the Program Option 
     Select (POS) registers.  The RAM is 16 bits wide and 
     accesses must be 16 bits wide on even byte boundaries only.
     There is an interrupt line enable bit (EIL in MICRO_CH.H) 
     which must be set.  The POS registers, not the MSR, set the 
     Shared RAM base address.  The cascaded interrupt controller 
     chip must be considered for interrupts higher than seven.

     8013EP/A, 8013WP/A (16-bit MCA)
     These are the second generation Micro Channel adapters.  The
     POS register bit definitions are different than the first
     generation Micro Channel adapters.  The range of I/O base
     addresses is from 0x0800 to 0xF800.  Refer to the WD83C594
     Data Sheet for more details.
 
     8013EBT (8/16-bit)
     This adapter powers up in 8003E emulation mode and has
     16-bit capability for RAM accesses from both the host and 
     the NIC side.  The adapter RAM may also be configured on 
     any 8K boundary within the first 16 Mbyte of address space.  
     Refer to DEFS8013.H.

     8003EB, 8003EP, 8003W (8-bit)
     These adapters are software configurable so that the driver
     may automatically configure itself.  The programming
     interface is basically the same as the 8003E.  Refer to
     DEFS583.H and the WD83C584 Data Sheet for more details.

     8013EP, 8013W, 8013EW (8/16-bit)
     These adapters are similar to the 8013EBT, with the added
     feature of being software configurable.  Refer to both
     DEFS8013.H and DEFS583.H and the WD83C584 Data Sheet for
     more details.


Board Identification routines have been provided to help facilitate
the support of multiple adapters in a given driver.  Refer to the
USER.DOC file included on the Sample Driver diskette.  The files
needed may be found in the SAMPLDRV directory on the Sample Driver
diskette.


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DP8390C AND WD83C690

The following summarizes the programming differences between
adapters built using the DP8390C and the WD83C690 NIC.  For
a more detailed description, see 690NOTES.DOC, included with
the Western Digital Sample Driver.

     1)   Multicast Address Registers
          The DP8390C provides a hashing algorithm to discard
          some of the received multicast packets from the
          network.  The WD83C690, however, receives either all
          or no multicast packets.  This binary function is 
          controlled by the AM bit of the RCR.

     2)   Receive Overflow Code
          The DP8390C specification describes the preferred
          method for overflow which includes stopping the chip,
          enabling loopback mode, restarting the chip, clearing
          at least one packet from the ring and disabling
          loopback mode.  The WD83C690, does not require this
          overhead.  Further, restarting the WD83C690 may
          produce unpredictable results.  For best results the
          driver should service received packets as usual.

     3)   The WD83C690 has the potential for posting a receive
          overflow interrupt with an empty receive ring.  The
          driver should check this condition and write the
          BNRY register with its current contents to proceed.

     4)   The WD83C690 could enter a locked state under heavy
          network traffic.  If the driver senses that the
          transmitter is hung, a software controlled hard reset
          must be performed (RST bit of the MSR).

     5)   Drivers running on a WD83C690 should verify received
          packets via the NIC header before passing the packet
          to the next layer of software.  If an invalid header
          is detected, the packet may be thrown away or the
          receive ring may be reinitialized, depending on the
          severity of the error.

     6)   If Internal Loopback is to be performed, the programmer
          should realize that the WD83C690 is a full duplex part
          and the DP8390C is half duplex.  To run internal
          loopback on the WD part, the receive ring must be
          initialized as for normal operation.  Transmitted
          packets are received into the ring and the data may be 
          verified.

OVERVIEW

This software is an example of a single driver that provides 
an interface to Western Digital's entire family of Ethernet,
StarLAN and Ethernet TP LAN adapter boards.  It is executable 
code taken from DIAGNOSE, an end-user diagnostic program that 
runs in an MS-DOS environment.  It may be used as is, modified 
to suit your particular needs or simply used to help you 
understand the adapters.  It is to your advantage to use it as an
aid in understanding the adapters.

SUPPORTED ADAPTERS

This sample driver supports all WD8003- and WD8013- family
adapters.

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR GETTING STARTED

1)  You must have the Microsoft "C" Compiler and Macro Assembler
    installed on your system with your path properly set to 
    access these tools.

    The Compiler version 5.1 was used to build the executable 
    on this disk, but compiler-specific options were avoided
    where possible.

2)  Copy the contents of this floppy disk to your hard disk 
    including all subdirectories.

3)  Type "MK<RETURN>" from the root subdirectory to build 
    the executable.

    This sample uses "MAKE" utility provided with Microsoft "C"
    along with a batch file called "MK.BAT".  The files used 
    with "MAKE" are called "MAKEFILE.MAK" and "LNK_HELP". 

    Note that this disk is distributed with SAMPLDRV.EXE
    already resident, so that the Sample Driver can be executed
    without performing this compilation step, if desired.

4)  Type "SAMPLDRV<RETURN>" to execute the sample driver.

5)  To establish communications on a 2-node network, have two 
    systems properly connected to the network and both running 
    the sample driver.  Have one node in "Respond" mode and one
    node in "Initiate" mode.

    First type <RETURN> at the "Respond" node and then type 
    <RETURN> at the "Initiate" node.

6)  Your monitors should now indicate that the sample drivers 
    are updating their Frames Sent and Frames Received statistics,
    and if so, you are up and running.


COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

Command line parameters for SAMPLDRV.EXE are only needed to 
change from the factory default configuration values for each
LAN adapter:

   /BASE:aaa    Specifies base I/O address (hex).
                   example:  /BASE:280
   /IRQ:n       Specifies interrupt level (IRQ). 
                   example:  /IRQ:3
   /RAM:aaaaa   Specifies shared memory base address of the 
                on-board RAM (5 digits-hex).
                   example:  /RAM:D8000
   /SLOT:n      Specifies the Micro Channel slot number which
                the adapter is plugged into.
                   example:  /SLOT:1
   /V           Displays the Sample Driver version number.
   /?           Displays a help screen for these command line
                parameters.


PERFORMANCE HINTS

Since this Sample Driver code was extracted from the DIAGNOSE.EXE 
end-user Diagnostic Program, its performance is not close to 
that of an actual driver customized for a real-time network
operating system.  It is provided as an example only to aid in
understanding the LAN adapter interfaces.

To increase performance, write the time sensitive code (such as 
interrupt service routines) in assembly language and reduce the 
number of calls from them by using in-line coding.

Another way of increasing performance is to remove the branching
for the intelligent adapters if your application does not use 
that type of adapter.  If an intelligent adapter is being used, more
functionality can be given to the adapter-resident processor.
This improves efficiency by reducing the interaction between 
the on-board processor and the PC host processor.


IDENTIFYING THE ADAPTER TYPE

Filters are included which identify the type of LAN adapter 
being used after being given its base I/O address.  The return 
value is a 32-bit code containing feature bits that combine to 
form a unique ID for each adapter type.

The Sample Driver uses an assembly language routine to provide
a C language interface to the routines found in the module
named INTERFACE.C in the \SAMPLDRV subdirectory.

Refer to the header files (GETCNFG.H and BOARD_ID.H) included
in the \INCLUDE subdirectory for more information (feature bits
and board ID definitions) on using this code.

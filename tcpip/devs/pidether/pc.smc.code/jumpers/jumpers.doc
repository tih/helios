Each Western Digital LAN adapter provides several parameters 
that may need to be configured prior to using the adapter in a 
network.  Some adapters are configured by setting appropriate 
jumpers on the board, others are configured via a software setup
program.  The following tables summarize the configuration options
for each adapter.

For more detailed information on any adapter, or for information on 
jumpers for an adapter that is not listed here, refer to the User 
Installation Guide that comes with the adapter.

Notes regarding XT/AT bus adapters:  

  o Each "PLUS"-family LAN adapter board contains a RAM buffer
    of 8, 16, or 32 Kbytes that occupies PC memory space.  The
    base address for this RAM memory is set by the software 
    you use, not by jumpers on the board.
    
  o Other add-on boards may introduce conflicts with this memory
    space.  Also, system conflicts can occur with the I/O base
    address and interrupt request level, which are controlled by   
    jumpers or are software configurable as described below.

For a Micro Channel bus board, the RAM base address, I/O base
address, boot ROM base address, and interrupt request level are
set by the system configuration procedure when the board is
installed.  Every software driver obtains this information
automatically and adjusts its operation accordingly.

"*" DENOTES THE SETTINGS OF JUMPERS INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY.

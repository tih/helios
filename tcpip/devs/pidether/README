VLSI ARM PID development board hosted ISA SMC ethercard PLUS
------------------------------------------------------------

This driver is only implemented for the VLSI ARM PID board. Its target is a
standard PC ISA board inserted into the single slot on the PID. The only PC
ethernet card supported is the SMC EtherCard PLUS (Elite16 Combo).

The PID board enables the ARM processor to use PC cards by mapping the PC
address space and port addresses into the ARM's address space. Interrupts are
similarly re-routed.

The directory pc.smc.code holds the example source code that SMC provide
to developers. Further example code for an earlier 8 bit only version of this
card is in the IO Server sources /hsrc/ioproc/server/ibm - (ether.c esupport.c).
The card is based on the western digital chipset comprising of the wd83c854 and
wd83c690. These are upwardly compatible with the previous 8 bit versions and the
National DP8390/NS32490C. Confusingly SMC call these chips the SMC83c854
/ SMC83c690, but actually use western digital chips on their boards.


ToDo

Currently the code #define'd by PC16BITS doesn't work. I cannot access the
PC bus memory as soon as I enable 16 bit accesses to the shared memory.
As it stands at the moment, the code should work with any early Western
Digital based eight bit cards as well. If 16 bit functionality is added, then
this compatibility should not be compromised, insted the board ID byte
(held after the cards ethernet station address) should be interrogated to
ascertain the functionality of the card.

If absolute performance is required, the interrupt handler should be coded
in Asm.
